<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE MEDICINE-MEN, THEIR MODES OF TREATING DISEASE,
THEIR SUPERSTITIONS, PARAPHERNALIA, ETC.</small></h2>


<p>The Caucasian population of the United States has been in intimate
contact with the aborigines for a period of not less than two hundred
and fifty years. In certain sections, as in Florida and New
Mexico, this contact has been for a still greater period; but claiming
no earlier date than the settlement of New England, it will be seen
that the white race has been slow to learn or the red man has been
skillful in withholding knowledge which, if imparted, would have lessened
friction and done much to preserve and assimilate a race that,
in spite of some serious defects of character, will for all time to come
be looked upon as "the noble savage."</p>

<p>Recent deplorable occurrences in the country of the Dakotas have
emphasized our ignorance and made clear to the minds of all thinking
people that, notwithstanding the acceptance by the native tribes of
many of the improvements in living introduced by civilization, the
savage has remained a savage, and is still under the control of an influence
antagonistic to the rapid absorption of new ideas and the
adoption of new customs.</p>

<p>This influence is the "medicine-man."</p>

<p>Who, and what are the medicine-men (or medicine-women), of the
American Indians? What powers do they possess in time of peace or
war? How is this power obtained, how renewed, how exercised?
What is the character of the remedies employed? Are they pharmaceutical,
as we employ the term, or are they the superstitious efforts of
empirics and charlatans, seeking to deceive and to misguide by pretended
consultations with spiritual powers and by reliance upon mysterious
and occult influences?</p>

<p>Such a discussion will be attempted in this paper, which will be
restricted to a description of the personality of the medicine-men, the
regalia worn, and the powers possessed and claimed. To go farther,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
and enter into a treatment of the religious ideas, the superstitions,
omens, and prayers of these spiritual leaders, would be to open a road
without end.</p>

<p>As the subject of the paraphernalia of the medicine-men has never,
to my knowledge, been comprehensively treated by any writer, I venture
to submit what I have learned during the twenty-two years of my
acquaintance with our savage tribes, and the studies and conclusions
to which my observations have led. While treating in the main of the
medicine-men of the Apache, I do not intend to omit any point of importance
noted among other tribes or peoples.</p>

<p>First, in regard to the organization of the medicine-men of the
Apache, it should be premised that most of my observations were made
while the tribe was still actively engaged in hostilities with the whites,
and they cannot be regarded as, and are not claimed to be, conclusive
upon all points. The Apache are not so surely divided into medicine
lodges or secret societies as is the case with the Ojibwa, as shown by Dr.
W. J. Hoffman; the Siouan tribes, as related by Mr. J. Owen Dorsey; the
Zu√±i, according to Mr. F. H. Cushing; the Tusayan, as shown by myself,
and other tribes described by other authorities.</p>

<p>The Navajo, who are the full brothers of the Apache, seem to have
well defined divisions among their medicine-men, as demonstrated by
Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army; and I myself have seen
great medicine lodges, which must have contained at least a dozen
Apache medicine-men, engaged in some of their incantations. I
have also been taken to several of the sacred caves, in which solemn
religious dances and other ceremonies were conducted under the same
superintendence, but never have I witnessed among the Apache any
rite of religious significance in which more than four or five, or at the
most six, of the medicine-men took part.</p>

<p>The difficulty of making an accurate determination was increased by
the nomadic character of the Apache, who would always prefer to live
in small villages containing only a few brush shelters, and not needing
the care of more than one or two of their "doctors." These people show an
unusual secretiveness and taciturnity in all that relates to their inner
selves, and, living as they do in a region filled with caves and secluded
nooks, on cliffs, and in deep canyons, have not been compelled to celebrate
their sacred offices in "estufas," or "plazas," open to the inspection of
the profane, as has been the case with so many of the Pueblo tribes.</p>

<p>Diligent and persistent inquiry of medicine-men whose confidence I
had succeeded in gaining, convinced me that any young man can become
a "doctor" ("diyi" in the Apache language, which is translated
"sabio" by the Mexican captives). It is necessary to convince his
friends that he "has the gift," as one of my informants expressed it;
that is, he must show that he is a dreamer of dreams, given to long
fasts and vigils, able to interpret omens in a satisfactory manner, and
do other things of that general nature to demonstrate the possession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
an intense spirituality. Then he will begin to withdraw, at least temporarily,
from the society of his fellows and devote himself to long absences,
especially by night, in the "high places" which were interdicted
to the Israelites. Such sacred fanes, perched in dangerous and
hidden retreats, can be, or until lately could be, found in many parts
in our remote western territory. In my own experiences I have found
them not only in the country of the Apache, but two-thirds of the way
up the vertical face of the dizzy precipice of T√¢aiyalana, close to Zu√±i,
where there is a shrine much resorted to by the young men who seek to
divine the result of a contemplated enterprise by shooting arrows into
a long cleft in the smooth surface of the sandstone; I have seen them
in the Wolf Mountains, Montana; in the Big Horn range, Wyoming; on
the lofty sides of Cloud Peak, and elsewhere. Maj. W.S. Stanton,
Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, ascended the Cloud Peak twice, and,
reaching the summit on the second attempt, he found that beyond the
position first attained and seeming then to be the limit of possible ascent,
some wandering Indian had climbed and made his "medicine."</p>

<p>While it is regarded as a surer mode of learning how to be a medicine-man
to seek the tuition of some one who has already gained power and
influence as such, and pay him liberally in presents of all kinds for a
course of instruction lasting a year or longer, I could learn of nothing
to prohibit a man from assuming the r√¥le of a prophet or healer of the
sick, if so disposed, beyond the dread of punishment for failure to cure
or alleviate sickness or infirmity. Neither is there such a thing as
settled dogma among these medicine-men. Each follows the dictates
of his own inclinations, consulting such spirits and powers as are
most amenable to his supplications and charms; but no two seem
to rely upon identically the same influences. Even in the spirit dance,
which is possibly the most solemn function in which the Apache medicine-men
can engage, the head-dresses and kilts adhered closely enough
to the one pattern, but the symbolism employed by each medicine-man
was entirely different from that adopted by his neighbors.</p>

<p>Schultze, Perrin du Lac, Adair, and others allude to "houses of mercy,"
the "right of asylum" in certain lodges and buildings, or even whole
villages, to which if the pursued of the tribe or even an enemy could
obtain admission his life was secure. Frank Gruard and others who
have lived for years among the Sioux, the Cheyenne, and other tribes
of the plains have assured me that the same right of asylum obtains
among them for the fugitive who takes shelter in the medicine lodge or
the council lodge, and almost parallel notions prevail among the
Apache. I have heard that the first American who came into one of
their villages, tired and hungry, was not molested in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>It is stated by Kelly<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that all warriors who go through the sun dance
of the Sioux rank thereafter as medicine-men. This statement seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
to me to be overdrawn. Nothing of the kind was learned by me at the
sun dance of the Sioux which I noted in 1881, and in any event the remark
would scarcely apply to the medicine-men of the Apache, who
have nothing clearly identifiable with the sun dance, and who do not
cut, gash, or in any manner mutilate themselves, as did the principal
participants in the sun dance, or as was done in still earlier ages by the
galli (the priests of Cybele) or the priests of Mexico.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us that the priests of Egypt, or rather the doctors,
who were at one time identified with them, were separated into classes;
some cured the eyes, some the ears, others the head or the belly. Such
a differentiation is to be observed among the Apache, Mohave, and
other tribes; there are some doctors who enjoy great fame as the bringers
of rain, some who claim special power over snakes, and some who
profess to consult the spirits only, and do not treat the sick except
when no other practitioner may be available. Among the Mohave, the
relatives of a dead man will consult one of these spirit-doctors and get
him to interview the ghosts who respond to his call and learn from them
whether the patient died from ignorance or neglect on the part of the
doctor who had charge of the case. If the spirits assert that he did,
then the culprit doctor must either flee for his life or throw the onus of
the crime upon some witch. This differentiation is not carried so far
that a medicine-man, no matter what his class, would decline a large
fee.</p>

<p>Balboa tells us<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
that the Peruvian priesthood was divided into classes,
each with its appropriate functions&mdash;the Guacos made the idols for the
temples, or rather, they made the idols speak; the others were necromancers
and spoke only with the dead; the Huecheoc divined by means
of tobacco and coco; the Caviocac became drunk before they attempted
to divine, and after them came the Rumatinguis and the Huachus already
mentioned.</p>

<p>In all nations in the infancy of growth, social or mental, the power
to coax from reluctant clouds the fructifying rain has been regarded
with highest approval and will always be found confided to the most
important hierophants or devolving upon some of the most prominent
deities; almighty Jove was a deified rain-maker or cloud-compeller.
Rain-makers flourished in Europe down to the time of Charlemagne,
who prohibited these "tempestiarii" from plying their trade.</p>

<p>One of the first requests made of Vaca and his comrades by the
people living in fixed habitations near the Rio Grande was "to tell the

it.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The prophet Samuel has been alluded to as a
rain-maker.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any inheritance of priestly functions
among the Apache or any setting apart of a particular clan or family
for the priestly duties.</p>

<p>Francis Parkman is quoted as describing a certain family among the
Miami who were reserved for the sacred ritualistic cannibalism perpetrated
by that tribe upon captives taken in war. Such families devoted
more or less completely to sacred uses are to be noted among the
Hebrews (in the line of Levi) and others; but they do not occur in the
tribes of the Southwest.</p>

<p>One of the ceremonies connected with the initiation, as with every
exercise of spiritual functions by the medicine-man, is the "ta-a-chi,"
or sweat-bath, in which, if he be physically able, the patient must participate.</p>

<p>The Apache do not, to my knowledge, indulge in any poisonous intoxicants
during their medicine ceremonies; but in this they differ to
a perceptible degree from other tribes of America. The "black
drink" of the Creeks and the "wisoccan" of the Virginians may be
cited as cases in point; and the Walapai of Arizona, the near neighbors
of the Apache, make use of the juice, or a decoction of the leaves, roots,
and flowers of the <i>Datura stramonium</i> to induce frenzy and exhilaration.
The laurel grows wild on all the mountain tops of Sonora and
Arizona, and the Apache credit it with the power of setting men crazy,
but they deny that they have ever made use of it in their medicine or
religion. Picart<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
speaks of the drink (wisoccan) which took away the
brains of the young men undergoing initiation as medicine-men among
the tribes of Virginia, but he does not say what this "wisoccan" was.</p>

<p>In Guiana,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
the candidate for the office of medicine-man must, among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
other ordeals, "drink fearfully large drafts of tobacco juice, mixed
with water." The medicine-men of Guiana are called peaiman.</p>

<p>I have never seen tobacco juice drank by medicine-men or others,
but I remember seeing Shunca-Luta (Sorrel Horse), a medicine-man of
the Dakota, chewing and swallowing a piece of tobacco and then going
into what seemed to be a trance, all the while emitting deep grunts or
groans. When he revived he insisted that those sounds had been
made by a spirit which he kept down in his stomach. He also pretended
to extract the quid of tobacco from underneath his ribs, and
was full of petty tricks of legerdemain and other means of mystifying
women and children.</p>

<p>All medicine-men claim the power of swallowing spear heads or
arrows and fire, and there are at times many really wonderful things
done by them which have the effect of strengthening their hold upon
the people.</p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Ojibwa thrust arrows and similar instruments
down their throats. They also allow themselves to be shot at
with marked bullets.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>While I was among the Tusayan, in 1881, I learned of a young boy,
quite a child, who was looked up to by the other Indians, and on special
occasions made his appearance decked out in much native finery of
beads and gewgaws, but the exact nature of his duties and supposed
responsibilities could not be ascertained.</p>

<p>Diego Duran<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
thought that the priesthood among the Mexicans was
to a great extent hereditary, much like the right of primogeniture
among the people of Spain. Speaking of the five assistants who held
down the human victim at the moment of sacrifice, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="es" xml:lang="es">Los nombres de los cinco eran Chachalmeca, que en nuestra Lengua quiere
tanto decir como Levita √≥ ministro de cosa divina √≥ sagrada. Era esta
dignidad entre ellos muy suprema y en mucha tenida, la cual se heredaba
de hijos √° padres como cosa de mayorazgo, sucediendo los hijos √° los
Padres en aquella sangrienta Dignidad endemoniada y cruel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Concerning the medicine-men of Peru,
Dorman<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The priestly office among the Peruvians appears to have been hereditary; some
attained it by election; a man struck by lightning was considered as chosen by
heaven; also those who became suddenly insane. Mr. Southey says that among the
Moxos of Brazil, who worshiped the tiger, a man who was rescued from but marked
by the claws of the animal, was set apart for the priesthood, and none other.</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall have occasion to introduce a medicine-woman of the Apache,
Tze-go-juni, or "Pretty-mouth," whose claims to preeminence among
her people would seem to have had no better foundation than her escape
from lightning stroke and from the bites of a mountain lion, which
had seized her during the night and had not killed her.</p>

<p>I remember the case of an old Navajo medicine-man who was killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
by lightning. The whole tribe participated in the singing, drumming,
and dancing incident to so important an event, but no white men were
allowed to be present. My information was derived from the dead
man's young nephew, while I was among that tribe.</p>

<p>Among the Arawak of South America there are hereditary conjurers
who profess to find out the enemy who by the agency of an evil spirit
has killed the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Picart says of the medicine-men of the tribes along Rio de la Plata:
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour √™tre Pr√™tre ou M√©decin parmi eux, il faut avoir je√ªn√© longtems
&amp; souvent. Il faut avoir combatu plusieurs fois contre les b√™tes Sauvages,
principalement contre les Tigres, &amp; tout au moins en avoir √©t√©
mordu ou √©gratign√©. Apr√®s cela on peut obtenir l'Ordre, de Pr√™trise;
car le Tigre est chez eux un animal presque
divin.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Apache are not confined to one gens or clan,
as among the Shawnee and Cherokee, according to
Brinton,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
neither
do they believe, as the Cherokee do, according to the same authority,
that the seventh son is a natural-born prophet with the gift of healing
by touch, but upon this latter point I must be discreet, as I have never
known an Apache seventh son.</p>

<p>The Cherokee still preserve the custom of consecrating a family of
their tribe to the priesthood, as the family of Levi was consecrated
among the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The neophytes of the isthmus of Darien were boys from ten to twelve
years "selected for the natural inclination or the peculiar aptitude
and intelligence which they displayed for the
service."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Peter Martyr says of the Chiribchis of South America: "Out of the
multitude of children they chuse some of 10 or 12 yeeres old, whom they
know by conjecture to be naturally inclined to that
service."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The peculiarity of the Moxos was that they thought none designated
for the office of medicine-man but such as had escaped from the claws
of the South American tiger which, indeed, it is said they worshiped as
a god.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Contrary to what Spencer says, the chiefs of the tribes of the Southwest,
at least, are not ipso facto medicine-men; but among the Tonto
Apache the brother of the head chief, Cha-ut-lip-un, was the great medicine-man,
and generally the medicine-men are related closely to the
prominent chiefs, which would seem to imply either a formal deputation
of priestly functions from the chiefs to relatives, or what may be practically
the same thing, the exercise of family influence to bring about
a recognition of the necromantic powers of some aspirant; but among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the Apache there is no priest caste; the same man may be priest, warrior,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"The juice of the Datura seed is employed by the Portuguese women
of Goa: they mix it, says Linschott, in the liquor drank by their husbands,
who fall, for twenty-four hours at least, into a stupor accompanied
by continued laughing; but so deep is the sleep that nothing
passing before them affects them; and when they recover their senses,
they have no recollection of what has taken
place."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"The Darien Indians used the seeds of the <i>Datura sanguinea</i> to bring
on in children prophetic delirium, in which they revealed hidden treasure.
In Peru the priests who talked with the 'huaca' or fetishes used
to throw themselves into an ecstatic condition by a narcotic drink called
'tonca,' made from the same
plant."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Walapai, according to Charlie Spencer, who
married one of their women and lived among them for years, were in
the habit of casting bullets in molds which contained a small piece of
paper. They would allow these bullets to be fired at them, and of
course the missile would split in two parts and do no injury. Again,
they would roll a ball of sinew and attach one end to a small twig,
which was inserted between the teeth. They would then swallow the
ball of sinew, excepting the end thus attached to the teeth, and after
the heat and moisture of the stomach had softened and expanded the
sinew they would begin to draw it out yard after yard, saying to the
frightened squaws that they had no need of intestines and were going
to pull them all out. Others among the Apache have claimed the
power to shoot off guns without touching the triggers or going near the
weapons; to be able to kill or otherwise harm their enemies at a distance
of 100 miles. In nearly every boast made there is some sort of a
saving clause, to the effect that no witchcraft must be made or the
spell will not work, no women should be near in a delicate state from
any cause, etc.</p>

<p>Mickey Free has assured me that he has seen an Apache medicine-man
light a pipe without doing anything but hold his hands up toward
the sun. This story is credible enough if we could aver that the medicine-man
was supplied, as I suspect he was, with a burning glass.</p>

<p>That the medicine-man has the faculty of transforming himself into a
coyote and other animals at pleasure and then resuming the human
form is as implicitly believed in by the American Indians as it was by
our own forefathers in Europe. This former prevalence of lycanthropy
all over Europe can be indicated in no more forcible manner than by
stating that until the reign of Louis XIV, in France, the fact of being
a were-wolf was a crime upon which one could be arraigned before a
court; but with the discontinuance of the crime the were-wolves themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
seem to have retired from
business.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
In Abyssinia, at the present
day, blacksmiths are considered to be were-wolves, according to
Winstanley. The Apache look upon blacksmiths as being allied to the
spirits and call them "pesh-chidin"&mdash;the witch, spirit, or ghost, of the
iron. The priestly powers conceded to the blacksmith of Gretna Green
need no allusion here.</p>

<p>According to Sir Walter
Scott,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
trials for lycanthropy were abolished
in France by an edict of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Parkman<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
describes, from the Relations of P√©re Le Jeune, how the
Algonkin medicine-man announced that he was going to kill a rival
medicine-man who lived at Gasp√©, 100 leagues distant.</p>

<p>The Abipones of Paraguay, according to Father Dobrizhoffer, "credit
their medicine-men with power to inflict disease and death, to cure all
disorders, to make known distant and future events; to cause rain,
hail, and tempest; to call up the shades of the dead and consult them
concerning hidden matters; to put on the form of a tiger; to handle
every kind of serpent without danger, etc.; which powers they imagine
are not obtained by art, but imparted to certain persons by their grandfather,
the devil."</p>

<p>The medicine-men of Honduras claimed the power of turning themselves
into lions and tigers and of wandering in the
mountains.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"Grandes Hechiceros i Bruxos, porque se hacian Perros, Puercos i
Ximios."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Gomara also calls attention to the fact that the medicine-men, "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hechiceros</span>"
and "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">brujos</span>," as he calls them, of the Nicaraguans, possessed
the power of lycanthropy; "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">segun ellos mismos decian, se hacen perros,
puercos y gimias</span>."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Great as are the powers claimed by the medicine-men, it is admitted
that baleful influences may be at work to counteract and nullify them.
As has already been shown, among these are the efforts of witches, the
presence of women who are sometimes supposed to be so "antimedicinal,"
if such a term may be applied, that the mere stepping over a warrior's
gun will destroy its value.</p>

<p>There may be other medicine-men at work with countercharms, and
there may be certain neglects on the part of the person applying for aid
which will invalidate all that the medicine-man can do for him. For
example, while the "hoop-me-koff" was raging among the Mohave the
fathers of families afflicted with it were forbidden to touch coffee or salt,
and were directed to bathe themselves in the current of the Colorado.
But the whooping cough ran its course in spite of all that the medicine-men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
could do to check its progress. When the Walapai were about to
engage in a great hunt continence was enjoined upon the warriors for a
certain period.</p>

<p>Besides all these accidental impairments of the vigor of the medicine-men,
there seems to be a gradual decadence of their abilities which can
be rejuvenated only by rubbing the back against a sacred stone projecting
from the ground in the country of the Walapai, not many miles
from the present town of Kingman, on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad.
Another stone of the same kind was formerly used for the same
purpose by the medicine-men of the pueblos of Laguna and Acoma, as
I have been informed by them. I am unable to state whether or not
such recuperative properties were ever ascribed to the medicine stone
at the Sioux agency near Standing Rock, S. Dak., or to the great stone
around which the medicine-men of Tusayan marched in solemn procession
in their snake dance, but I can say that in the face of the latter,
each time that I saw it (at different dates between 1874 and 1881), there
was a niche which was filled with votive offerings.</p>

<p>Regnard, a traveler in Lapland, makes the statement that when the
shamans of that country began to lose their teeth they retired from
practice. There is nothing of this kind to be noted among the Apache
or other tribes of North America with which I am in any degree familiar.
On the contrary, some of the most influential of those whom I have
known have been old and decrepit men, with thin, gray hair and teeth
gone or loose in their heads. In a description given by Corbusier of a
great "medicine" ceremony of the Apache-Yuma at Camp Verde, it is
stated that the principal officer was a "toothless, gray-haired
man."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Among many savage or barbarous peoples of the world albinos have
been reserved for the priestly office. There are many well marked examples
of albinism among the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona,
especially among the Zu√±i and Tusayan; but in no case did I learn that
the individuals thus distinguished were accredited with power not
ascribable to them under ordinary circumstances. Among the Cheyenne
I saw one family, all of whose members had the crown lock white.
They were not medicine-men, neither were any of the members of the
single albino family among the Navajo in 1881.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that among the Romans epilepsy was looked
upon as a disease sent direct from the gods, and that it was designated
the "sacred disease"&mdash;morbus sacer. Mahomet is believed to have
been an epileptic. The nations of the East regard epileptics and the
insane as inspired from on high.</p>

<p>Our native tribes do not exactly believe that the mildly insane are
gifted with medical or spiritual powers; but they regard them with a
feeling of superstitious awe, akin to reverence. I have personally
known several cases of this kind, though not within late years, and am
not able to say whether or not the education of the younger generation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
in our schools has as yet exercised an influence in eradicating this sentiment.</p>

<p>Strange to say, I was unable to find any observance of lucky or
unlucky days among the Apache. The Romans in the period of their
greatest enlightenment had their days, both "fasti" and "nefasti."
Neither was I able to determine the selection of auspicious days for
marriage; indeed, it was stated that the medicine-men had nothing to
do with marriage. Among the Zapotecs the wedding day was fixed
by the priests.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
In this the Apache again stands above the Roman who
would not marry in the month dedicated to the goddess Maia (May),
because human sacrifice used to be offered in that month. This superstition
survived in Europe until a comparatively recent period. According
to Picart the Hebrew rabbis designated the days upon which
weddings should take place.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
says that the medicine-men of the Arawaks claimed
the "jus prim√¶ noctis." There is no such privilege claimed or conceded
among the North American tribes, to my knowledge, and the Arawaks
would seem to be alone among the natives of the whole continent in
this respect.</p>

<p>In the town of Cuman√°, in Amaracapanna, apparently close to
Carthagena, in the present republic of Colombia, South America, the
medicine-men, according to Girolamo Benzoni, exercised the "jus
prim√¶ noctis."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>To recover stolen or lost property, especially ponies, is one of the
principal tasks imposed upon the medicine-men. They rely greatly
upon the aid of pieces of crystal in effecting this. I made a friend of
an Apache medicine-man by presenting him with a large crystal of denticulated
spar, much larger than the one of whose mystical properties
he had just been boasting to me. I can not say how this property of
the crystal is manifested. Na-a-cha, the medicine-man alluded to, could
give no explanation, except that by looking into it he could see everything
he wanted to see.</p>

<p>The name of an American Indian is a sacred thing, not to be divulged
by the owner himself without due consideration. One may ask a
warrior of any tribe to give his name and the question will be met with
either a point-blank refusal or the more diplomatic evasion that he can
not understand what is wanted of him. The moment a friend approaches,
the warrior first interrogated will whisper what is wanted,
and the friend can tell the name, receiving a reciprocation of the courtesy
from the other. The giving of names to children is a solemn matter,
and one in which the medicine-men should always be consulted.
Among the Plains tribes the children were formerly named at the
moment of piercing their ears, which should occur at the first sun
dance after their birth, or rather as near their first year as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
The wailing of the children at the sun dance as their ears were slit
will always be to me a most distressing memory.</p>

<p>The warriors of the Plains tribes used to assume agnomens or battle
names, and I have known some of them who had enjoyed as many as
four or five; but the Apache name once conferred seems to remain
through life, except in the case of the medicine-men, who, I have always
suspected, change their names upon assuming their profession, much
as a professor of learning in China is said to do.</p>

<p>The names of mothers-in-law are never mentioned and it would be
highly improper to ask for them by name; neither are the names of the
dead, at least not for a long period of time. But it often happens that
the child will bear the name of its grandfather or some other relative
who was a distinguished warrior.</p>

<p>All charms, idols, talismans, medicine hats, and other sacred regalia
should be made, or at least blessed, by the medicine-men. They assume
charge of all ceremonial feasts and dances&mdash;such as the nubile dance,
which occurs when any maiden attains marriageable age, and war
dances preceding battle. Nearly all preparations for the warpath are
under their control, and when on the trail of the enemy their power is
almost supreme. Not a night passes but that the medicine-men get
into the "ta-a-chi," or sweat bath, if such a thing be possible, and
there remain for some minutes, singing and making "medicine" for the
good of the party. After dark they sit around the fire and sing and
talk with the spirits and predict the results of the campaign. I have
alluded quite fully to these points in a previous work.</p>

<p>When a man is taken sick the medicine-men are in the zenith of their
glory. One or two will assume charge of the case, and the clansmen
and friends of the patient are called upon to supply the fire and help
out in the chorus. On such occasions the Apache use no music except
a drum or a rawhide. The drum is nearly always improvised from an
iron camp kettle, partially filled with water and covered with a piece of
cloth, well soaped and drawn as tight as possible. The drumstick does
not terminate in a ball, as with us, but is curved into a circle, and the
stroke is not perpendicular to the surface, but is often given from one
side to the other. The American Indian's theory of disease is the
theory of the Chaldean, the Assyrian, the Hebrew, the Greek, the
Roman&mdash;all bodily disorders and ailments are attributed to the maleficence
of spirits who must be expelled or placated. Where there is only
one person sick, the exercises consist of singing and drumming exclusively,
but dancing is added in all cases when an epidemic is raging in
the tribe. The medicine-men lead off in the singing, to which the
assistants reply with a refrain which at times has appeared to me to
be antiphonal. Then the chorus is swelled by the voices of the women
and larger children and rises and falls with monotonous cadence.
Prayers are recited, several of which have been repeated to me and
transcribed; but very frequently the words are ejaculatory and confined
to such expressions as "ugashe" (go away), and again there is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
be noted the same mumbling of incoherent phrases which has been the
stock in trade of medicine-men in all ages and places. This use of
gibberish was admitted by the medicine-men, who claimed that the
words employed and known only to themselves (each individual seemed
to have his own vocabulary) were mysteriously effective in dispelling
sickness of any kind. Gibberish was believed to be more potential in
magic than was language which the practitioner or his dupes could
comprehend. In Saxon Leechdoms, compiled by Cockayne, will be
seen a text of gibberish to be recited by those wishing to stanch the
flow of blood. (See p. 464.)</p>

<p>Henry Youle Hind says:</p>

Indian tongues and dialects; they make much use of descriptive expressions, and
use words apart from the ordinary signification. The Ojibways abbreviate their
sentences and employ many elliptical forms of expression, so much so that half-breeds,
quite familiar with the colloquial language, fail to comprehend a medicine-man
when in the full flow of excited
oratory.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></blockquote>

that description of charlatanism which consists in the use of gestures,
postures, and mysterious speeches, as byplay, and which formed an
accompaniment to the proceedings of the thaumaturgist well calculated

<p>Sahagun<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>

language known only to the initiated.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that the monotonous intonation of the medicine-men
is not without good results, especially in such ailments as can be
benefited by the sleep which such singing induces. On the same principle
that petulant babies are lulled to slumber by the crooning of their
nurses, the sick will frequently be composed to a sound and beneficial
slumber, from which they awake refreshed and ameliorated. I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
recall, among many other cases, those of Chaundezi ("Long Ear," or
"Mule") and Chemihuevi-Sal, both chiefs of the Apache, who recovered
under the treatment of their own medicine-men after our surgeons
had abandoned the case. This recovery could be attributed only to
the sedative effects of the chanting.</p>

<p>Music of a gentle, monotonous kind has been prescribed in the medical
treatment of Romans, Greeks, and even of comparatively modern
Europeans. John Mason Goode, in his translation of Lucretius' De
Natura Rerum, mentions among others Galen, Theophrastus, and Aulus
Gellius. An anonymous writer in the Press of Philadelphia, Pa., under
date of December 23, 1888, takes the ground that its use should be
resumed.</p>

<p>The noise made by medicine-men around the couch of the sick is no
better, no worse, than the clangor of bells in Europe. Bells, we are
told, were rung on every possible occasion. Brand is full of quaint
information on this head. According to him they were rung in Spain
when women were in labor,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>

<p>Adair, who was gifted with an excellent imagination, alludes to the
possession of an "ark" by the medicine-men of the Creeks and other
tribes of the Mississippi country, among whom he lived for so many
years as a trader. The Apache have no such things; but I did see a
sacred bundle or package, which I was allowed to feel, but not to open,
and which I learned contained some of the lightning-riven twigs upon
which they place such dependence. This was carried by a young
medicine-man, scarcely out of his teens, during Gen. Crook's expedition
into the Sierra Madre, Mexico, in 1883, in pursuit of the hostile
Chiricahua Apache. Maj. Frank North also told me that the Pawnee
had a sacred package which contained, among other objects of veneration,
the skin of an albino buffalo calf.</p>

<p>There are allusions by several authorities to the necessity of confession
by the patient before the efforts of the medicine-men can prove
efficacious.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>
<p>This confession, granting that it really existed, could well be compared
to the warpath secret, which imposed upon all the warriors
engaged the duty of making a clean breast of all delinquencies and
secured them immunity from punishment for the same, even if they had
been offenses against some of the other warriors present.</p>

<p>The Sioux and others had a custom of "striking the post" in their
dances, especially the sun dance, and there was then an obligation upon
the striker to tell the truth. I was told that the medicine-men were wont
to strike with a club the stalagmites in the sacred caves of the Apache,
but what else they did I was not able to ascertain.</p>

<p>Under the title of "hoddentin" will be found the statement made by
one of the Apache as to the means employed to secure the presence
of a medicine-man at the bedside of the sick. I give it for what it is
worth, merely stating that Kohl, in his Kitchi-Gami, if I remember correctly,
refers to something of the same kind where the medicine-man is
represented as being obliged to respond to every summons made unless
he can catch the messenger within a given distance and kick him.</p>

<p>There is very little discrepancy of statement as to what would happen
to a medicine-man in case of failure to cure; but many conflicting
stories have been in circulation as to the number of patients he would
be allowed to kill before incurring risk of punishment. My own conclusions
are that there is no truth whatever in the numbers alleged,
either three or seven, but that a medicine-man would be in danger,
under certain circumstances, if he let only one patient die on his hands.
These circumstances would be the verdict of the spirit doctors that he
was culpably negligent or ignorant. He could evade death at the hands
of the patient's kinsfolk only by flight or by demonstrating that a witch
had been at the bottom of the
mischief.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Medicine-men, called "wizards" by Falkner, sometimes were killed
by the Patagonians, when unsuccessful in their treatment, and were
also obliged to wear women's clothing. They were selected in youth
for supposed qualifications, especially if
epileptic.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In Hispaniola we are told that when a man died his friends resorted
to necromancy to learn whether he had died through the neglect of the
attending medicine-man to observe the prescribed fasts. If they found
the medicine-man guilty, they killed him and broke all his bones. In
spite of this the medicine-man often returned to life and had to be
killed again, and mutilated by castration and
otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Herrera repeats the story about a patient who died and whose relatives
felt dissatisfied with the medicine-man:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="es" xml:lang="es">Para saber si la muerte fue por su culpa, tomaban el √ßumo de cierta Ierva, i cortaban
las v√±as del muerto, i los cabellos de encima de la frente, i los hacian polvos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
i mezclados con el √ßumo, se lo daban √† beber al muerto por la boca, i las narices, i
luego le preguntaban muchas veces, si el Medico guard√≤ dieta, hasta que hablando
el demonio, respondia tan claro, como si fuera vivo, i decia, que el Medico no hi√ßo
dieta, i luego le bolvian √† la sepultura.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the relatives attacked the medicine-man: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">I le daban tantos
palos, que le quebraban los bra√ßos, i las piernas, i √† otros sacaban los
ojos, i los cortaban sus miembros
genitales.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Alexander the Great expressed his sorrow at the death of his friend
Heph√¶stion by crucifying the poor physicians who had attended the
deceased.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Natchez were put to death when they failed
to cure.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Apache attach as much importance to the necessity of "laying
the manes" of their dead as the Romans did. They have not localized
the site of the future world as the Mohave have, but believe that the
dead remain for a few days or nights in the neighborhood of the place
where they departed from this life, and that they try to communicate
with their living friends through the voice of the owl. If a relative hears
this sound by night, or, as often happens, he imagines that he has
seen the ghost itself, he hurries to the nearest medicine-man, relates his
story, and carries out to the smallest detail the prescription of feast,
singing, dancing, and other means of keeping the spirit in good humor
on the journey which it will now undertake to the "house of spirits,"
the "chidin-bi-kungua." Nearly all medicine-men claim the power of
going there at will, and not a few who are not medicine-men claim the
same faculty.</p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Apache are paid by each patient or by his
friends at the time they are consulted. There is no such thing as a
maintenance fund, no system of tithes, nor any other burden for their
support, although I can recall having seen while among the Zu√±i one
of the medicine-men who was making cane holders for the tobacco to
be smoked at a coming festival, and whose fields were attended and
his herds guarded by the other members of the tribe.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the medicine-men do not attend to their own families,
neither do they assist in cases of childbirth unless specially
needed. To both these rules there are exceptions innumerable. While
I was at San Carlos Agency, Surgeon Davis was sent for to help in a
case of uterine inertia, and I myself have been asked in the pueblo of
Namb√©, New Mexico, to give advice in a case of puerperal fever.</p>

<p>The medicine-men are accused of administering poisons to their
enemies. Among the Navajo I was told that they would put finely
pounded glass in food.</p>

<p>There are medicine-women as well as medicine-men among the
Apache, with two of whom I was personally acquainted. One named
"Captain Jack" was well advanced in years and physically quite
feeble, but bright in intellect and said to be well versed in the lore of
her people. She was fond of instructing her grandchildren,
whom she supported, in the prayers and invocations
to the gods worshiped by her fathers, and I have several
times listened carefully and unobserved to these recitations
and determined that the prayers were the same as those
which had already been given to myself as those of the
tribe. The other was named Tze-go-juni, a Chiricahua,
and a woman with a most romantic history. She had
passed five years in captivity among the Mexicans in Sonora
and had learned to speak Spanish with facility. A
mountain lion had severely mangled her in the shoulder
and knee, and once she had been struck by lightning; so
that whether by reason of superior attainments or by an
appeal to the superstitious reverence of her comrades, she
wielded considerable influence. These medicine-women
devote their attention principally to obstetrics, and have
many peculiar stories to relate concerning pre-natal influences
and matters of that sort. Tze-go-juni wore at her neck the stone
amulet, shaped like a spear, which is figured in the illustrations of this
paper. The material was the silex from the top of a mountain, taken
from a ledge at the foot of a tree which had been struck by lightning.
The fact that siliceous rock will emit sparks when struck by another
hard body appeals to the reasoning powers of the savage as a proof that
the fire must have been originally deposited therein by the bolt of lightning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>A tiny piece of this arrow or lance was broken off and ground into
the finest powder, and then administered in water to women during time
of gestation. I have found the same kind of arrows in use among the
women of Laguna and other pueblos. This matter will receive more
extended treatment in my coming monograph on "Stone Worship."</p>

<p>Mendieta is authority for the statement that the Mexicans had both
medicine-men and medicine-women. The former attended to the sick
men and the latter to the sick women. "√Å las mujeres siempre las curaban

Some of the medicine-women
seem to have made an illicit use of the knowledge they had
acquired, in which case both the medicine-woman and the woman concerned
were put to death. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">La mujer pre√±ada que tomaba con que

<p>Bernal Diaz, in 1568, speaks of having, on a certain occasion, at the
summit of a high mountain, found "an Indian woman, very fat, and
having with her a dog of that species, which they breed in order to eat,

of sacrificing the dog, which is a signal of
hostility."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>"The office of medicine-man though generally usurped by males does
not appertain to them exclusively, and at the time of our visit the one
most extensively known was a black (or meztizo) woman, who had acquired
the most unbounded influence by shrewdness, joined to a hideous
personal appearance, and a certain mystery with which she was
invested."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Creeks have medicine-women as well as medicine-men.

<p>Speaking of the Chippewa, Spencer says: "Women may practice
soothsaying, but the higher religious functions are performed only by

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>
<p>The medicine-men of the Apache do not assume to live upon food
different from that used by the laity. There are such things as sacred
feasts among the tribes of North America&mdash;as, for example, the feast
of stewed puppy at the sun dance of the Sioux&mdash;but in these all people
share.</p>

<p>In the mortuary ceremonies of the medicine-men there is a difference
of degree, but not of kind. The Mohave, however, believe that the
medicine-men go to a heaven of their own. They also believe vaguely
in four different lives after this one.</p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca says that the Floridians buried their ordinary dead,
but burned their medicine-men, whose incinerated bones they preserved
and drank in water.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>

Schultze says that the medicine-men of the Sioux and
the medicine-women also, after death "may be transformed into wild
beasts."<a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Surgeon Smart shows that among other offices entrusted to the medicine-men
of the Apache was the reception of distinguished
strangers.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Long asserts that the medicine-men of the Otoe, Omaha, and others
along the Missouri pretended to be able to converse with the fetus in
utero and predict the
sex.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Nothing of that kind has ever come under
my notice. Adair says that the medicine-men of the Cherokee would
not allow snakes to be
killed.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
The Apache will not let snakes be killed
within the limits of the camp by one of their own people, but they will
not only allow a stranger to kill them, but request him to do so. They
made this request of me on three occasions.</p>

<p>Several of the most influential medicine-men whom I have known
were blind, among others old Na-ta-do-tash, whose medicine hat figures
in these pages. Whether this blindness was the result of old
age or due to the frenzy of dancing until exhausted in all seasons I am
unable to conjecture. Schultze says of the shamans of Siberia: "This
artificial frenzy has such a serious effect upon the body, and more particularly
the eyes, that many of the shamans become blind; a circumstance
which enhances the esteem in which they are
held."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Some of
the medicine-men of Peru went blind from overexertion in their dances,
although Gomara assigns as a reason that it was from fear of the demon
with whom they talked. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Y aun algunos se quiebran los ojos para
semejante hablar [i.e., talk with the devil]; y creo que lo hacian de
miedo, porque todos ellos se atapan los ojos cuando hablan con
el.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Dunbar tells us that the medicine-men of the Pawnee swallowed
arrows and knives, and had also the trick of apparently killing a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
and bringing him back to life. The same power was claimed by the
medicine-men of the Zu√±i, and the story told me by old Pedro Pino of
the young men whom they used to kill and restore to life, will be found
in "The Snake Dance of the Moquis."</p>


<h3>REMEDIES AND MODES OF TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>The materia medica of the Apache is at best limited and comprehends
scarcely anything more than roots, leaves, and other vegetable
matter. In gathering these remedies they resort to no superstitious
ceremonies that I have been able to detect, although I have not often
seen them collecting. They prefer incantation to pharmacy at all
times, although the squaws of the Walapai living near old Camp
Beale Springs in 1873, were extremely fond of castor oil, for which they
would beg each day.</p>

<p>The main reliance for nearly all disorders is the sweat bath, which is
generally conducive of sound repose. All Indians know the benefit to be
derived from relieving an overloaded stomach, and resort to the titillation
of the fauces with a feather to induce nausea. I have seen the
Zu√±i take great drafts of lukewarm water and then practice the above
as a remedy in dyspepsia.</p>

<p>When a pain has become localized and deep seated, the medicine-men
resort to suction of the part affected, and raise blisters in that
way. I was once asked by the Walapai chief, Sequanya, to look at
his back and sides. He was covered with cicatrices due to such treatment,
the medicine-men thinking thus to alleviate the progressive
paralysis from which he had been long a sufferer, and from which he
shortly afterwards died. After a long march, I have seen Indians of
different bands expose the small of the back uncovered to the fierce
heat of a pile of embers to produce a rubefacient effect and stimulate
what is known as a weak back. They drink freely of hot teas or infusions
of herbs and grasses for the cure of chills. They are all dextrous
in the manufacture of splints out of willow twigs, and seem to
meet with much success in their treatment of gunshot wounds, which
they do not dress as often as white practitioners, alleging that the
latter, by so frequently removing the bandages, unduly irritate the
wounds. I have known them to apply moxa, and I remember to have
seen two deep scars upon the left hand of the great Apache chief Cochise,
due to this cause.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that the world owes a large debt to the
medicine-men of America, who first discovered the virtues of coca, sarsaparilla,
jalap, cinchona, and guiacum. They understand the administration
of enemata, and have an apparatus made of the paunch of a
sheep and the hollow leg bone.</p>

<p>Scarification is quite common, and is used for a singular purpose.
The Apache scouts when tired were in the habit of sitting down and
lashing their legs with bunches of nettles until the blood flowed. This,
according to their belief, relieved the exhaustion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>The medicine-men of the Floridians, according to Vaca, sucked and
blew on the patient, and put hot stones on his abdomen to take away
pain; they also scarified, and they seemed to have used moxas. "Ils
caut√©risent aussi avec le
feu."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The medicine-men of Hispaniola cured by suction, and when they had
extracted a stone or other alleged cause of sickness it was preserved
as a sacred relic, especially by the women, who looked upon it as
of great aid in parturition.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Venegas speaks of a tube called the
"chacuaco," formed out of a very hard black stone, used by the medicine-men
of California in sucking such parts of the patient's body as
were grievously afflicted with pains. In these tubes they sometimes
placed lighted tobacco and blew down upon the part affected after the
manner of a moxa, I
suppose.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The men of Panuco were so addicted to drunkenness that we are
told: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lorsqu'ils sont fatigu√©s de boire leur vin par la bouche, ils se
couchent, √©l√®vent les jambes en l'air, et s'en font introduire dans le
fondement au moyen d'une canule, taut que le corps peut en
contenir.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The administration of wine in this manner may have been as a medicine,
and the Aztecs of Panuco may have known that nutriment could
be assimilated in this way. It shows at least that the Aztecs were
acquainted with enemata.</p>

Smith says that the medicine-men of

One of the most
curious remedies presented in Bancroft's first volume is the use of a

habit of scarifying their tired legs and aching

The Arawaks,

<p>It has never been my good fortune to notice an example of trephining
among our savage tribes, although I have seen a good many wounded,
some of them in the head. Trephining has been practiced by the
aborigines of America, and the whole subject as noted among the
primitive peoples of all parts of the globe has been treated in a monograph
by Dr. Robert Fletcher, U. S.
Army.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Fordyce Grinnell, who was for some years attached to the
Wichita Agency as resident physician, has published the results of his
observations in a monograph, entitled "The healing art as practiced
by the Indians of the Plains," in which he says: "Wet cupping is
resorted to quite frequently. The surface is scarified by a sharp stone
or knife, and a buffalo horn is used as the cupping glass. Cauterizing
with red-hot irons is not infrequently employed." A cautery of "burning
pith" was used by the
Araucanians.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

the efficacy of his
incantations."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
"The [Apache] scouts seem to prefer

The promptness with which the
American Indian recovers from severe wounds has been commented
upon by many authorities. From my personal observation I could,
were it necessary, adduce many examples. The natives of Australia
seem to be endowed with the same recuperative
powers.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>After all other means have failed the medicine-men of the Southwest
devote themselves to making altars in the sand and clay near the couch
of the dying, because, as Antonio Besias explained, this act was all the
same as extreme unction. They portray the figures of various animals,
and then take a pinch of the dust or ashes from each one and rub upon
the person of the sick man as well as upon themselves. Similar altars
or tracings were made by the medicine-men of Guatemala when they
were casting the horoscope of a child and seeking to determine what
was to be its medicine in life. This matter of sand altars has been fully
treated by Matthews in the report of the Bureau of Ethnology for 1883-'84,
and there are several representations to be found in my Snake Dance
of the Moquis. "Writing on sand" is a mode of divination among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Padre Boscana represents the "puplem" or medicine-men
of the Indians of California as making or sketching "a most uncouth
and ridiculous figure of an animal on the ground," and presumably of
sands, clays, and other such
materials.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>


<h3>HAIR AND WIGS.</h3>

<p>The medicine-men of the Apache were, at least while young, extremely
careful of their hair, and I have often seen those who were very properly
proud of their long and glossy chevelure. Particularly do I recall
to mind the "doctor" at San Carlos in 1885, who would never allow
his flowing black tresses to be touched. But they do not roach their
hair, as I have seen the Pawnee do; they do not add false hair to their
own, as I have seen among the Crow of Montana and the Mohave of the
Rio Colorado; they do not apply plasters of mud as do their neighbors
the Yuma, Cocopa, Mohave and Pima, and in such a manner as to
convince spectators that the intent was ceremonial; and they do not
use wigs in their dances. Wigs made of black wool may still be found
occasionally among the Pueblos, but the Apache do not use them, and
there is no reference to such a thing in their myths.</p>

<p>It is to be understood that these paragraphs are not treating upon
the superstitions concerning the human hair, as such, but simply of the
employment of wigs, which would seem in former days among some of
the tribes of the Southwest to have been made of human hair presented
by patients who had recovered from sickness or by mourners
whose relatives had died.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Wigs with masks attached were worn by
the Costa Ricans, according to
Gabb.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Some of the Apache-Yuma men wear long rolls of matted hair behind,
which are the thickness of a finger, and two feet or more in length, and
composed of old hair mixed with that growing on the head, or are in the
form of a wig, made of hair that has been cut off when mourning the
dead, to be worn on occasions of
ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Observations of the same kind have been made by Speke upon the
customs of the people of Africa in his

speaking of Greenland. Sir Samuel Baker
describes the peculiar wigs worn by the tribes on Lake Albert Nyanza,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>

with clay into a stiff
mass.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

maisons des animaux velus, grands comme des chiens d'Espagne. Ils

sent by the Viceroy Mendoza to the Emperor Charles V. Exactly what
these domesticated animals were, it would be hard to say; they may
possibly have been Rocky Mountain
sheep,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
though Mr. Cushing, who
has studied the question somewhat extensively, is of the opinion that
they may have been a variety of the llama.</p>

<p>The Assinaboine used to wear false hair, and also had the custom of
dividing their hair into "joints" of an inch or more, marked by a sort
of paste of red earth and
glue;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>

In this
they both resemble the Mohave of the Rio Colorado. "The Algonquins

death."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The Apache, until within the last twenty years, plucked out the eyelashes
and often the eyebrows, but only a few of them still persist in
the practice. Kane says that the Winnebagoes "have the custom of
pulling out their eyebrows."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>

<h3>MUDHEADS.</h3>

<p>Reference has been made to a ceremonial plastering of mud upon the
heads of Indians. When General Crook was returning from his expedition
into the Sierra Madre, Mexico, in 1883, in which expedition a few
of the enemy had been killed, the scouts upon reaching the San Bernardino
River made a free use of the sweat bath, with much singing
and other formulas, the whole being part of the lustration which all
warriors must undergo as soon as possible after being engaged in battle.
The Apache proper did not apply mud to their heads, but the Apache-Yuma
did.</p>

<p>Capt. Grossman, U. S.
Army,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
says of the Pima method of purification
after killing an Apache, that the isolation of the warrior lasts
for sixteen days, during which period no one speaks to him, not even
the old woman who brings him his food. The first day he touches
neither food nor drink, and he eats sparingly for the whole time, touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
neither meat nor salt; he bathes frequently in the Gila River and
nearly the whole time keeps his head covered with a plaster of mud
and mesquite.</p>

<p>"The boyes [of the Massagueyes] of seven or eight yeeres weare clay
fastned on the hayre of the head, and still renewed with new clay,
weighing sometimes five or six pounds. Nor may they be free hereof
till in warre or lawfull fight hee hath killed a
man."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>According to Padre Geronimo Boscana, the traditions of the Indians
of California show that they "fed upon a kind of
clay."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
But this clay
was often plastered upon their heads "as a kind of ornament." These
were the Indians of San Juan Capistrano, who strongly resembled the
Mohave. After all, the "mudheads" of the Mohave are no worse than
those people in India who still bedaub their heads with "the holy
mud of the Ganges." Up to this time the mud has been the "blue
mud" of the Colorado and other rivers, but when we find Herbert
Spencer mentioning that the heads of the Comanche are "besmeared
with a dull red clay" we may suspect that we have stumbled upon an
analogue of the custom of the Aztec priests, who bedaubed their heads
with the coagulating lifeblood of their human victims. We know that
there has been such a substitution practiced among the Indians of the
Pueblo of Jemez, who apply red ocher to the mouth of the stone
mountain lion, in whose honor human blood was once freely shed. The
practice of so many of the Plains tribes of painting the median line of
the head with vermilion seems to be traceable back to a similar custom.</p>


<h3>SCALP SHIRTS.</h3>

<p>The shirt depicted on Pl. <span class="smcap">III</span>, made of buckskin and trimmed with
human scalps, would seem to belong to the same category with the
mantles made of votive hair, mentioned as being in use among the
California tribe a little more than a century ago. It was presented to
me by Little Big Man, who led me to believe that it had once belonged
to the great chief of the Sioux, Crazy Horse, or had at least been worn
by him. Of its symbolism I am unable to find the explanation. The
colors yellow and blue would seem to represent the earth and water or
sky, the feathers attached would refer to the birds, and the round circle
on the breast is undoubtedly the sun. There is a cocoon affixed to one
shoulder, the significance of which I do not know.</p>

<h3>THE RHOMBUS, OR BULL ROARER.</h3>

<p>The rhombus was first seen by me at the snake dance of the Tusayan,
in the village of Walpi, Ariz., in the month of August, 1881. Previous
to that date I had heard of it vaguely, but had never been able to
see it in actual use. The medicine-men twirled it rapidly, and with a
uniform motion, about the head and from front to rear, and succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
in faithfully imitating the sound of a gust of rain-laden wind. As explained
to me by one of the medicine-men, by making this sound they
compelled the wind and rain to come to the aid of the crops. At a
later date I found it in use among the Apache, and for the same purpose.
The season near the San Carlos Agency during the year 1884
had been unusually dry, and the crops were parched. The medicine-men
arranged a procession, two of the features of which were the rhombus
and a long handled cross, upon which various figures were depicted.
Of the latter, I will speak at another time.</p>

<p>Again, while examining certain ruins in the Verde Valley, in central
Arizona, I found that the "Cliff Dwellers," as it has become customary
to call the prehistoric inhabitants,
had employed the same weapon
of persuasion in their intercourse
with their gods. I found the
rhombus also among the Rio
Grande Pueblo tribes and the
Zu√±i. Dr. Washington Matthews
has described it as existing among
the Navajo and Maj. J. W. Powell
has observed it in use among
the Utes of Nevada and Utah.
As will be shown, its use in all
parts of the world seems to have
been as general as that of any
sacred implement known to primitive
man, not even excepting the
sacred cords or rosaries discussed
in this paper. Three forms of the
rhombus have come under my
own observation, each and all apparently
connected in symbolism
with the lightning. The first terminates
in a triangular point, and
the general shape is either that
of a long, narrow, parallelogram,
capped with an equilateral triangle,
or else the whole figure is that
of a slender isosceles triangle. Where the former shape was used, as at
the Tusayan snake dance, the tracing of a snake or lightning in blue or
yellow followed down the length of the rhombus and terminated in the
small triangle, which did duty as the snake's head. The second pattern
was found by Dr. Matthews among the Navajo, and by myself in the old
cliff dwellings. The one which I found was somewhat decayed, and the
extremity of the triangle was broken off. There was no vestige of painting
left. The second form was serrated on both edges to simulate the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
of the snake or lightning. The third form, in use among the Apache,
is an oblong of 7 or 8 inches in length, one and a quarter inches in
width by a quarter in thickness. One extremity, that through which
the cord passes, is rounded to rudely represent a human head, and the
whole bears a close resemblance to the drawings of schoolboys which
are intended for the human figure. The Apache explained that the
lines on the front side of the rhombus were the entrails and those on
the rear side the hair of their wind god. The hair is of several colors,
and represents the lightning. I did not ascertain positively that such
was the case, but was led to believe that the rhombus of the Apache
was made by the medicine-men from wood, generally pine or fir, which
had been struck by lightning on the mountain tops. Such wood is
held in the highest estimation among them, and is used for the manufacture
of amulets of especial efficacy. The Apache name for the rhombus
is tzi-ditindi, the "sounding wood." The identification of the
rhombus or "bull roarer" of the ancient Greeks with that used by the
Tusayan in their snake dance was first made by E. B. Tylor in the
Saturday Review in a criticism upon "The Snake Dance of the Moquis
of Arizona."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kaffirs have the rhombus among their playthings:</p>

<blockquote><p>The nodiwu is a piece of wood about 6 or 8 inches long, and an inch and a half
or 2 inches wide, and an eighth or a quarter of an inch thick in the middle.
Towards the edges it is beveled off, so that the surface is convex, or consists of two
inclined planes. At one end it has a thong attached to it by which it is whirled
rapidly round. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;There is a kind of superstition connected with the nodiwu,
that playing with it invites a gale of wind. Men will, on this account, often prevent
boys from using it when they desire calm weather for any purpose. This superstition
is identical with that which prevents many sailors from whistling at
sea.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of the Peruvians we are informed that "their belief was that there
was a man in the sky with a sling and a stick, and that in his power
were the rain, the hail, the thunder, and all else that appertains to the
regions of the air, where clouds are
formed."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The sacred twirler of the snake dance is found in Greece, America,
Africa and New Zealand. It survives as a toy in England and the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
The same peculiar instrument has been noticed in the
religious ceremonials of the Australians, especially in the initiatory
rites of the "bora." It is called the
"tirricoty."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
The twirling of the
tzi-ditindi in medicine or prayer corresponds to the revolution of the
prayer wheel of the Lamas.</p>


<h3>THE CROSS.</h3>

<p>The sign of the cross appears in many places in Apache symbolism.
The general subject of the connection of the cross with the religion of
the aborigines of the American continent has been so fully traversed by
previous authors that I do not care to add much more to the subject
beyond saying that my own observation has assured me that it is related
to the cardinal points and the four winds, and is painted by warriors
upon their moccasins upon going into a strange district in the hope of
keeping them from getting on a wrong trail.</p>

<p>In October, 1884, I saw a procession of Apache men and women, led
by the medicine-men bearing two crosses, made as follows: The vertical
arm was 4 feet 10 inches long, and the transverse between 10 and
12 inches, and each was made of slats about 1&#189; inches wide, which looked
as if they had been long in use. They were decorated with blue polka
dots upon the unpainted surface. A blue snake meandered down the
longer arm. There was a circle of small willow twigs at top; next below
that, a small zinc-cased mirror, a bell, and eagle feathers. Nosey, the
Apache whom I induced to bring it to me after the ceremony, said that
they carried it in honor of Guzanutli to induce her to send rain, at that
time much needed for their crops. It is quite likely that this particular
case represents a composite idea; that the original beliefs of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Apache have been modified to some extent by the crude ideas of the
Mexican captives among them, who still remember much that was taught
them in the churches of the hamlets in northern Mexico, from which
they were kidnapped years ago; but, on the other hand, it is to be remembered
that the cross has always formed a part of the Apache symbolism;
that the snake does not belong to the Christian faith, and that
it has never been allowed to appear upon the cross since the time of the
Gnostics in the second and third centuries. Therefore, we must regard
that as a Pagan symbol, and so must we regard the circle of willow
twigs, which is exactly the same as the circle we have seen attached to
the sacred cords for the cure of
headache.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The cross was found in full vogue as a religious emblem among the
aborigines all over America. Father Le
Clercq<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
speaks of its very general
employment by the Gaspesians: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils ont parmi eux, tout infideles
qu'ils soient, la Croix en singuliere veneration, qu'ils la portent figur√©e
sur leurs habits &amp; sur leur chair; qu'ils la tiennent √† la main dans
tous leurs vo√Øages, soit par mer, soit par terre; &amp; qu'enfin ils la posent
au dehors &amp; au dedans de leurs Cabannes, comme la marque d'honneur
qui les distingue des autres Nations du Canada.</span>" He
narrates<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
that the
Gasp√© tradition or myth was, that the whole tribe being ravaged by a
plague, the medicine-men had recourse to the Sun, who ordered them
to make use of the cross in every extremity.</p>

<p>Herrera relates that the followers of Hernandez de Cordoba found at
Cape Catoche "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">unos Adoratorios ... i Cruces pintadas que les
caus√≤ gran admiracion.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
He also says that Juan de Grijalva on the
island of Cozumel found a number of oratories and temples, but one in
particular was made in the form of a square tower, with four openings.
Inside this tower was a cross made of lime, which the natives reverenced
as the god of the rain; "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">una Cruz de Cal, de tres varas en alto,
√† la qual tenian por el Dios de la

<h3>NECKLACES OF HUMAN FINGERS.</h3>

<p>The necklace of human fingers, an illustration of which accompanies
this text (Pl. <span class="smcap">IV</span>), belonged to the foremost of the medicine-men of a
brave tribe&mdash;the Cheyenne of Montana and Wyoming. They were the
backbone of the hostility to the whites, and during the long and arduous
campaign conducted against them by the late Maj. Gen. George
Crook, which terminated so successfully in the surrender of 4,500 of the
allied Sioux and Cheyenne, at Red Cloud and Spotted Tail agencies, in
the early spring of 1877, it was a noted fact that wherever a band of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
Cheyenne was to be found there the fighting was most desperate. It
is a matter now well established that the Cheyenne are an offshoot of
the Algonquian family, speaking a dialect closely resembling that of the
Cree, of British America.</p>

NECKLACE OF HUMAN FINGERS.</span>
</div>

<p>It may interest some readers to listen to a few words descriptive of
the manner in which such a ghastly relic of savagery came into my possession.
On the morning of the 25th of November, 1876, the cavalry
and Indian scouts (Sioux, Shoshoni, Arapaho, Pawnee, and a few of the
Cheyenne themselves), of Gen. Crook's command, under the leadership
of the late Brig. Gen. Ranald S. Mackenzie, then colonel of the Fourth
Cavalry, surprised and destroyed the main village of the Cheyenne, on
the headwaters of the Powder River, in the Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming.
The onslaught was irresistible, the destruction complete, and
the discomfited savages were forced to flee from their beds, half naked
and with nothing save their arms and ammunition. More than half of
the great herd of ponies belonging to the savages were killed, captured,
or so badly wounded as to be of no use to the owners. The cold became
so intense that on the night after the fight eleven papooses froze to death
in their mothers' arms, and the succeeding night, three others. This
blow, the most grievous ever inflicted upon the plains tribes, resulted
in the surrender, first of the Cheyenne, and later on of the principal chief
of the Sioux, the renowned Crazy Horse; after which the Sioux troubles
were minimized into the hunt for scattered bands. Undoubtedly, among
the bitterest losses of valuable property suffered by the Cheyenne on
this occasion were the two necklaces of human fingers which came into
my possession, together with the small buckskin bag filled with the right
hands of papooses belonging to the tribe of their deadly enemies, the
Shoshoni. These were found in the village by one of our scouts&mdash;Baptiste
Pourrier, who, with Mr. Frank Gruard, was holding an important
and responsible position in connection with the care of the great body
of Indian scouts already spoken of. From these two gentlemen I afterwards
obtained all the information that is here to be found regarding
the Cheyenne necklace.</p>

<p>The second necklace, consisting of four fingers, was buried, as Gen.
Crook did not wish to have kept more than one specimen, and that only
for scientific purposes. Accordingly, the necklace here depicted was
sent first to the U. S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and
later to the National Museum in Washington, where it was believed it
could better fulfill its mission of educating students in a knowledge of
the manners and customs of our aborigines.</p>

<p>The buckskin bag, with the papooses' hands, was claimed by the
Shoshoni scouts, who danced and wailed all night, and then burned the
fearful evidence of the loss sustained by their people.</p>

<p>The necklace is made of a round collar of buckskin, incrusted with
the small blue and white beads purchased from the traders, these being
arranged in alternate spaces of an inch or more in length. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
also attached numbers of the perforated wampum shell beads of native
manufacture. Pendant from this collar are five medicine arrows, the
exact nature of which, it was, of course, impossible to determine from
the owner himself. Both Frank and Baptiste agreed that an arrow
might become "medicine" either from having been shot into the person
of the owner himself or into the body of an enemy, or even from having
been picked up under peculiar circumstances. The owner, High Wolf or
Tall Wolf, admitted as much after he had surrendered at the Red Cloud
Agency and had made every effort to obtain the return of his medicine,
which was this necklace.</p>

<p>The four medicine bags to be seen in the picture are worthy of attention.
They were carefully examined under a powerful glass by Dr. H.
C. Yarrow, U. S. Army, in the city of Washington, and pronounced to
be human scrota. The first of these contained a vegetable powder,
somewhat decomposed, having a resemblance to hoddentin; the second
was filled with killikinnick; the third with small garnet-colored seeds
like the chia in use among the Apache, and the fourth with a yellow,
clayey-white vegetable matter not identified. The fifth, also, remained
unidentified.</p>

<p>Besides the above, there are artificial teeth, resembling those of the
fossil animals abundant in the Bad Lands of South Dakota, but cut out
of soft stone.</p>

<p>The fingers&mdash;eight altogether&mdash;are the left-hand middle fingers of
Indians of hostile tribes, killed by High Wolf. I obtained the list and
could insert it here were it worthwhile to do so. The fingers have not
been left in the natural state, but have been subjected to very careful
and elaborate antiseptic treatment in order thoroughly to desiccate them.
They were split longitudinally on the inner side and after the bone had
been extracted the surface of the skin, both inside and out, received a
treatment with a wash or paint of ocherous earth, the same as is used
for the face. I was told that the bones were not replaced but that sticks
were inserted to maintain the fingers in proper shape.</p>

<p>Of the reason for making use of such a trophy or relic, there is not
much to be said; even the savages know little and say less. From the
best information that I have been able to gather, it would seem to be
based partly upon a vainglorious desire to display the proofs of
personal prowess, and partly upon the vague and ill defined, but deeply
rooted, belief in the talismanic or "medicinal" potency possessed by all
parts of the human body, especially after death. It was such a belief
which impelled the Mandan, Aztecs, and others of the American tribes
to preserve the skulls of their dead as well as (among the Aztecs) those
of the victims sacrificed in honor of their gods. As has been shown in
another place, the Zu√±i and others take care to offer food at stated
periods to the scalps of their enemies.</p>

<p>The use of necklaces of human fingers or of human teeth is to be
found in many parts of the world, and besides the fingers themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
we find the whole arm, or in other cases only the nails. The Cheyenne
did not always restrict themselves to fingers; they generally made use
of the whole hand, or the arm of the slaughtered enemy. In a colored
picture drawn and painted by one of themselves I have a representation
of a scalp dance, in which the squaws may be seen dressed in their
best, carrying the arms of enemies elevated on high poles and lances.
There is no doubt in my mind that this custom of the Cheyenne of cutting
off the arm or hand gave rise to their name in the sign language of
the "Slashers," or "Wrist Cutters," much as the corresponding tribal
peculiarity of the Dakota occasioned their name of the "Coupe Gorge"
or "Throat Cutters."</p>

<p>The necklace of human fingers is found among other tribes. A
necklace of four human fingers was seen by the members of the Lewis
and Clarke expedition among the Shoshoni at the headwaters of the
Columbia, in the early years of the present century. Early in the
spring of 1858 Henry Youle Hind refers to the allies of the Ojibwa on
Red River as having "two fingers severed from the hands of the unfortunate
Sioux."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>

did cut off and keep the arms and legs of a slain enemy or, rather, the
hands and feet and head. They also had the habit of plucking out
and preserving the eyes.</p>

<p>Kohl assures us that he has been informed that the Ojibwa will

I have served with the Cheyenne a great deal and have spoken about
their customs. My necklace is of human fingers mummified, not of
bones.</p>

<p>The necklace of human fingers is not a particle more horrible than the
ornaments of human bones to be seen in the cemetery of the Capuchins
in Rome at the present day. I have personally known of two or three
cases where American Indians cut their enemies limb from limb. The
idea upon which the practice is based seems to be the analogue of the
old English custom of sentencing a criminal to be "hanged, drawn,
and quartered."</p>

<p>Brand gives a detailed description of the "hand of glory," the possession
of which was believed by the peasantry of Great Britain and
France to enable a man to enter a house invisible to the occupants. It
was made of the hand of an executed (hanged) murderer, carefully desiccated
and prepared with a great amount of superstitious mummery.
With this holding a candle of "the fat of a hanged man" burglars felt
perfectly secure while engaged in their predatory
work.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
The belief was
that a candle placed in a dead man's hand will not be seen by any but
those by whom it is used. Such a candle introduced into a house kept
those who were asleep from awakening.</p>

throughout France, Germany, Spain, and Great Britain. As late as
the year 1831 it was used by Irish burglars in the county Meath.</p>

<h3>NECKLACES OF HUMAN TEETH.</h3>

<p>A number of examples are to be found of the employment of necklaces
of human teeth. In my own experience I have never come across
any specimens, and my belief is that among the Indians south of the
Isthmus such things are to be found almost exclusively. I have found
no reference to such ornamentation or "medicine" among the tribes of
North America, but there are many to show the very general dissemination
of the custom in Africa and in the islands of the South Sea.
Gomara says that the Indians of Santa Marta wore at their necks, like

This custom of the Australians does not obtain among
the North American tribes, by whom the teeth, as they fall out, are
carefully hidden or buried under some tree or rock. At least, I have
been so informed by several persons, among others by Chato, one of
the principal men of the Chiricahua Apache.</p>

<p>The preceding practice is strictly in line with the "medicinal" and
"magical" values attached in Europe to human teeth, human skin, etc.
The curious reader may find much on this subject in the works of Frommann,
Beckherius, Etm√ºller, Samuel Augustus Flemming, and others
of the seventeenth century, where it will be shown that the ideas of the
people of Europe of that period were only in name superior to those of
the savages of America, the islands of the South Seas, and of Central
Africa. In my work upon "The Scatalogic Rites of all Nations" I have
treated this matter more in extenso, but what is here adduced will be
sufficient for the present article.</p>

<h3>THE SCRATCH STICK.</h3>

<p>When Gen. Crook's expedition against the Chiricahua Apache
reached the heart of the Sierra Madre, Mexico, in 1883, it was my good
fortune to find on the ground in Geronimo's rancheria two insignificant
looking articles of personal equipment, to which I learned the Apache
attached the greatest importance. One of these was a very small piece
of hard wood, cedar, or pine, about two and a half to three inches long
and half a finger in thickness, and the other a small section of the cane
indigenous to the Southwest and of about the same dimensions. The
first was the scratch stick and the second the drinking reed.</p>

<p>The rule enjoined among the Apache is that for the first four times
one of their young men goes out on the warpath he must refrain from
scratching his head with his fingers or letting water touch his lips.
How to keep this vow and at the same time avoid unnecessary personal
discomfort and suffering is the story told by these petty fragments from
the Apache's ritual. He does not scratch his head with his fingers; he
makes use of this scratch stick. He will not let water touch his lips,
but sucks it into his throat through this tiny tube. A long leather cord
attached both stick and reed to the warrior's belt and to each other.
This was all the information I was able to obtain of a definite character.
Whether these things had to be prepared by the medicine-men or by
the young warrior himself; with what ceremonial, if any, they had to
be manufactured, and under what circumstances of time and place, I
was unable to ascertain to my own satisfaction, and therefore will
not extend my remarks or burden the student's patience with incoherent
statements from sources not absolutely reliable. That the use
of the scratch stick and the drinking reed was once very general in
America and elsewhere, and that it was not altogether dissociated from
ritualistic or ceremonial ideas, may be gathered from the citations
appended.</p>

<p>In her chapter entitled "Preparatory ceremony of the young warrior"
Mrs. Emerson says: "He does not touch his ears or head with
his hand," explaining in a footnote, "the head was sometimes made a
sacrificial offering to the
sun."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Tanner relates that the young Ojibwa
warrior for the "three first times" that he accompanies a war party
"must never scratch his head or any other part of his body with his
fingers, but if he is compelled to scratch he must use a small
stick."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Kohl states that the Ojibwa, while on the warpath, "will never sit down
in the shade of a tree or scratch their heads; at least, not with their
fingers. The warriors, however, are permitted to scratch themselves
with a piece of wood or a
comb."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>

comb they [the men] have a small stick hanging by a string from one

purpose."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

skin with his nails, but always with a small stick for that purpose,
which he renews every fourth day and wears in his hair."</p>

<p>As part of the ceremony of "initiating youth into manhood" among
the Creeks, the young neophyte "during the twelve moons ... is
also forbidden to pick his ears or scratch his head with his fingers, but
must use a small splinter to perform these
operations."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>

<p>The idea that these scratch sticks replace combs is an erroneous one;
Indians make combs in a peculiar way of separate pieces of wood, and
they are also very fond of brushing their long locks with the coarse
brushes, which they make of sacaton or other grass.</p>

<p>"One other regulation, mentioned by Schomburgk, is certainly quaint;

<p>In German folk-lore there are many references to the practice in

without comment.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Of the Abyssinians, Bruce says: "Their hair is short and curled like

desires."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
In a footnote, he adds: "I apprehend this is the same instrument
used by the ancients, and censured by the prophets, which in our

<p>Possibly the constant use of the scratch stick in countries without
wood suggested that it should be carried in the hair, and hence it
would originate the fashion of wearing the hair crimped round it, and
after a while it would itself be used as a crimping-pin.</p>

<p>Thus far, the suggestion of a religious or ceremonial idea attaching
to the custom of scratching has not been apparent, unless we bear in
mind that the warrior setting out on the warpath never neglects to surround
himself with all the safeguards which the most potent incantations
and "medicine" of every kind can supply. But Herbert Spencer
tells us in two places that the Creeks attach the idea of a ceremonial
observance to the custom. He says that "the warriors have a ceremony
of scratching each other as a sign of
friendship;"<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
and again, "scratching
is practiced among young warriors as a ceremony or token of friendship.
When they have exchanged promises of inviolable attachment,
they proceed to scratch each other before they
part."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Dr. J. Hampden Porter remarks that this ceremonial scratching may
be a "survival" of the blood covenant, and that in earlier times the
young warriors, instead of merely scratching each other's arms, may
have cut the flesh and exchanged the blood. The idea seems to be a
very sensible one.</p>

<p>Father Alegre describes a ceremonial scratching which may have
been superseded by the scratch stick, to which the medicine-men of
certain tribes subjected the young men before they set out on the warpath.
Among the Pima and Opata the medicine-men drew from their
quivers the claws of eagles, and with these gashed the young man along
the arms from the shoulders to the
wrists.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>This last paragraph suggests so strongly certain of the practices at
the sun dance of the tribes farther to the north that it may be well to
compare it with the other allusions in this paper to that dance.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the use of the scratch-stick, at least among
the tribes of America, seems to be confined to the male sex; but the
information is supplied by Mr. Henshaw, of the Bureau of Ethnology,
that the Indians of Santa Barbara, Cal., made their maidens at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
time of attaining womanhood wear pendant from the neck a scratcher
of abalone shell, which they had to use for an indefinite period when
the scalp became irritable.</p>

<p>Prof. Otis T. Mason, of the National Museum, informs me that there
is a superstition in Virginia to the effect that a young woman enciente
for the first time must, under no circumstances, scratch her head with
her fingers, at least while uncovered; she must either put on gloves or
use a small stick.</p>

<p>The Parsi have a festival at which they serve a peculiar cake or bread
called "draona," which is marked by scratches from the finger nails of
the woman who has baked it.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>No stress has been laid upon the appearance in all parts of the world
of "back scratchers" or "scratch my backs," made of ivory, bone, or
wood, and which were used for toilet purposes to remove irritation from
between the shoulder blades or along the spine where the hand itself
could not reach. They are to the present day in use among the Chinese
and Japanese, were once to be found among the Romans and other
nations of Europe, and instances of their occasional employment until
a very recent date might be supplied.</p>


<h3>THE DRINKING REED.</h3>

<p>Exactly what origin to ascribe to the drinking reed is now an impossibility,
neither is it probable that the explanations which the
medicine-men might choose to make would have the slightest value in
dispelling the gloom which surrounds the subject. That the earliest
conditions of the Apache tribe found them without many of the comforts
which have for generations been necessaries, and obliged to
resort to all sorts of expedients in cooking, carrying, or serving their
food is the most plausible presumption, but it is submitted merely as a
presumption and in no sense as a fact. It can readily be shown that
in a not very remote past the Apache and other tribes were compelled
to use bladders and reeds for carrying water, or for conveying water,
broth, and other liquid food to the lips. The conservative nature of
man in all that involves his religion would supply whatever might be
needed to make the use of such reeds obligatory in ceremonial observances
wherein there might be the slightest suggestion of religious impulse.
We can readily imagine that among a people not well provided
with forks and spoons, which are known to have been of a much later
introduction than knives, there would be a very decided danger of
burning the lips with broth, or of taking into the mouth much earthy
and vegetable matter or ice from springs and streams at which men
or women might wish to drink, so the use of the drinking reed would
obviate no small amount of danger and discomfort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>
<p>Water was carried in reeds by the Dyaks of Borneo, according to
Bock.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
The manner in which the natives of the New Hebrides and
other islands of the South Pacific Ocean carry water in bamboo joints
recalls the Zu√±i method of preserving the sacred water of the ocean in
hollow reeds.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Mr. F. H. Cushing shows that
"so far as language indicates the
character of the earliest water
vessels which to any extent met
the requirements of the Zu√±i ancestry,
they were tubes of wood
or sections of canes."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Long after
these reeds had disappeared
from common use, the priests still
persisted in their use for carrying
the water for the sacred ceremonies.
The mother of the king
of Uganda gave to Speke "a
beautifully-worked pomb√©
sucking-pipe."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
For ordinary purposes these people have "drinking gourds."
In Ujiji, Cameron saw an old chief sucking pomb√©, the native beer,
through a reed;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
and, later on in his narrative, we learn that the reed
is generally used for the purposes of drinking. "The Malabars reckoned
it insolent to touch the vessel with their lips when
drinking."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
They made use of vessels with a spout, which were no more and no
less than the small hollow-handled soup ladles of the Zu√±i and Tusayan,
through which they sipped their hot broth.</p>

<p>In an ancient grave excavated not far from Salem, Massachusetts, in
1873, were found five skeletons, one of which was supposed to be that
of the chief Nanephasemet, who was killed in 1605 or 1606. He was
the king of Namkeak. On the breast of this skeleton were discovered
"several small copper tubes ... from 4 to 8 inches in length, and
from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter, made of copper
rolled up, with the edges
lapped."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Alarcon relates that the tribes seen on the Rio Colorado by him in

The Mexicans, according to
Fray Diego Duran, placed before the statues of their dead bowls of
"vino," with "rosas," tobacco (this seems to be the proper translation
of the word "humazos," smokes), and a reed called the "drinker of the
sun," through which the spirit could
imbibe.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>"The suction pipes of steatite," mentioned by Schoolcraft, as found in
the mounds, may have been the equivalents of our drinking reeds, and
made of steatite to be the more readily preserved in the ritual of which
they formed part.</p>

<p>Copper cylinders 1&#188; inches long and &#8540; of an inch in diameter were found
in the mounds of the Mississippi Valley by Squier and Davis. The
conjecture that they had been used "for ornaments" does not seem
warranted.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>We should not forget that there was a semideification of the reed
itself by the Aztec in their assignment of it to a place in their calendar
under the name of
"acatl."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Ellen Russell Emerson speaks of the custom the warriors of the
northern tribes had which suggests that she had heard of the drinking
reed without exactly understanding what it meant. She says that warriors
carry bowls of birch bark "from one side of which the warrior drinks
in going to battle&mdash;from the other, on his return. These bowls are not
carried home, but left on the prairie, or suspended from trees within a
day's journey of his
village."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Among the Brahmans practices based upon somewhat similar ideas
are to be found: every morning, upon rising, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ils prennent trois fois de
l'eau dans la main, &amp; en jettent trois fois dans leur bouche, √©vitant d'y
toucher avec la main.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>
<p>The fundamental reason upon which the use of the drinking reed is
based is that the warrior or devotee shall not let water touch his lips.
It is strange to find among the regulations with regard to taking water
by the warrior caste: "He shall not sip water while walking, standing,
lying down, or bending
forward."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The Dharma-s√ªtra, traditionally connected with the Rishi-Vasishtha,
of the Seventh Mandala of the Rig-Veda, is a relic of a Vedic school of
the highest antiquity. Its seat was in the present northwestern provinces
of India, and, like the Dharmas√¢stra of Gautama, it is the sole
surviving record from this
source.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>There was another service performed by reeds or tubes in the domestic
economy of nations around the north pole. As the Apache are derived
from an Arctic ancestry it does not seem amiss to allude to it. Lord
Lonsdale, in describing the capture of a whale which he witnessed, says
that the Eskimo women "first of all gathered up the harpoons and
then pulled out all the spears. As each spear was withdrawn a blow-pipe
was pushed into the wound and the men blew into it, after which
the opening was tied up. When every wound had been treated in this
manner the whale resembled a great windbag and floated high in the
water."</p>

<p>In the National Museum at Washington, D. C., there are many pipes
made of the bones of birds, which were used by the Inuit as drinking
tubes when water had to be taken into the mouth from holes cut in the
ice. These drinking tubes seem to be directly related to our subject,
although they may also have been used as Lonsdale describes the pipes
for blowing the dead whale full of air. Another point to be mentioned
is that the eagle pipe kept in the mouth of the young warrior undergoing
the torture of the sun dance among the Sioux and other tribes on
the plains is apparently connected with the "bebedero del Sol" of the
peoples to the south.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The use of this drinking reed, shown to have been once so intimately
associated with human sacrifice, may have disappeared upon the introduction
of labrets, which seem, in certain cases at least, to be associated
with the memory of enemies killed in battle, which would be only
another form of human sacrifice. This suggestion is advanced with
some misgivings, and only as a hypothesis to assist in determining for
what purpose labrets and drinking tubes have been employed. The
Apache have discontinued the use of the labret, which still is to be
found among their congeners along the Lower Yukon, but not among
those living along the lower
river.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
According to Dall the custom was
probably adopted from the Inuit; he also shows that whenever labrets
are worn in a tribe they are worn by both sexes, and that the women
assume them at the first appearance of the catamenia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>
<p>"This is to be noted, that how many men these Savages [Brazilians]
doe kill, so many holes they will have in their visage, beginning first in
their nether lippe, then in their cheekes, thirdly, in both their eye-browes,
and lastly in their eares."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca speaks of the Indians near Malhado Island, "They
likewise have the nether lippe bored, and within the same they carrie a
piece of thin Cane about halfe a finger
thicke."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Herrera relates very
nearly the same of the men of "Florida": "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tra√¨an una tetilla oradada,
metido por el agujero un peda√ßo de Ca√±a, i el labio baxero tambien
agujereado, con otra ca√±a en

But Herrera probably obtained his
data from the narrative of Vaca.</p>

<p>In looking into this matter of labrets as connected or suspected as
being in some way connected with the drinking reed, we should not
expect to find the labret adhering very closely to the primitive form,
because the labret, coming to be regarded more and more as an ornament,
would allow greater and greater play to the fancy of the wearer
or manufacturer, much the same as the crosses now worn by ladies,
purely as matter of decoration, have become so thoroughly examples of
dexterity in filagree work as to have lost the original form and significance
as a declaration of faith. But it is a subject of surprise to find
that the earlier writers persistently allude to the labrets in the lips of
the Mexican deities, which probably were most tenacious of primitive
forms, as being shaped like little reeds&mdash;"ca√±utillos."</p>

<p>Herrera says of Tescatlipoca: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que era el Dios de la Penitencia, i

The high priest,
he says, was called topil√ßin, and in sacrificing human victims he wore
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">debaxo del labio, junto al medio de la barba, una pie√ßa como ca√±utillo,

<p>Father Acosta also speaks of the tube (canon) of crystal worn by
Tezcatlipoca in the lower lip: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En la leure d'embas un petit canon de
crystal, de la longueur d'un xeme ou demy

hung a crystal tube."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
From Diego Duran's account of this "bezote"
or labret it must have been hollow, as he says it contained a feather:
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">En el labio bajo tenia un bezote de un veril cristalino y en el estaba

<p>In the Popul Vuh is to be found a myth which gives an account of
the origin of labrets. It relates that two night watchers over the flowers

<small>HODDENTIN, THE POLLEN OF THE TULE, THE SACRIFICIAL
POWDER OF THE APACHE; WITH REMARKS UPON SACRED
POWDERS AND BREAD OFFERINGS IN GENERAL.</small></h2>


<p>"Trifles not infrequently lead to important results. In every walk of
science a trifle disregarded by incurious thousands has repaid the
inquisitiveness of a single observer with unhoped-for
knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The taciturnity of the Apache in regard to all that concerns their
religious ideas is a very marked feature of their character; probably no
tribe with which our people have come in contact has succeeded more
thoroughly in preserving from profane inquiry a complete knowledge
of matters relating to their beliefs and ceremonials. How much of this
ignorance is to be attributed to interpreters upon whom reliance has
necessarily been placed, and how much to the indisposition of the
Apache to reveal anything concerning himself, it would be fruitless to
inquire, but, in my own experience, when I first went among them in
New Mexico and Arizona twenty-three years ago, I was foolish enough
to depend greatly upon the Mexican captives who had lived among
the Apache since boyhood, and who might be supposed to know exactly
what explanation to give of every ceremony in which the Apache might
engage. Nearly every one of these captives, or escaped captives, had
married among the Apache, and had raised families of half-breed
children, and several of them had become more Apache than the Apache
themselves. Yet I was time and again assured by several of these interpreters
that the Apache had no religion, and even after I had made
some progress in my investigations, at every turn I was met by the
most contradictory statements, due to the interpreter's desire to inject
his own views and not to give a frank exposition of those submitted by
the Apache. Thus, an Apache god would be transmuted into either a
"santo" or a "diablo," according to the personal bias of the Mexican
who happened to be assisting me. "Assanutlije" assumed the disguise
of "Maria Santissima," while ceremonies especially sacred and beneficent
in the eyes of the savages were stigmatized as "brujeria" and
"hechiceria" (witchcraft) in open defiance of the fact that the Apache
have as much horror and dread of witches as the more enlightened of
their brethren who in past ages suffered from their machinations in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
Europe and America. The interpreters had no intention to deceive;
they were simply unable to disengage themselves from their own prejudices
and their own ignorance; they could not, and they would not,
credit the existence of any such thing as
religion, save and excepting that taught
them at their mothers' knees in the petty
hamlets of Sonora and of which they still
preserved hazy and distorted recollections.
One of the first things to be noticed
among the Apache, in this connection,
was the very general appearance of little
bags of buckskin, sometimes ornamented,
sometimes plain, which were ordinarily
attached to the belts of the warriors, and
of which they seemed to be especially
careful.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<span class="caption">Fig.

</div>

<p>What follows in this chapter was not
learned in an hour or a day, but after a
long course of examination and a comparison
of statements extracted from different
authorities.</p>

<p>The bags spoken of revealed when opened a quantity of yellow colored
flour or powder, resembling cornmeal, to which the Apache gave the
name of "hoddentin," or "hadntin," the meaning of which word is "the
powder or pollen of the tule," a variety of the cat-tail rush, growing in
all the little ponds and cienegas of the Southwest.</p>

<p>I made it the touchstone of friendship that every scout or other
Apache who wished for a favor at my hands should relate something
concerning his religious belief. I did not care much what topic he selected;
it might be myths, clan laws, war customs, medicine&mdash;anything
he pleased, but it had to be something and it had to be accurate.
Hoddentin having first attracted my attention, I very naturally made
many of my first inquiries about it, and, while neglecting no opportunity
for independent observation, drew about me the most responsible men
and women, heard what each had to say, carefully compared and contrasted
it with the statements of the others, and now give the result.</p>

<p>I noticed that in the dances for the benefit of the sick the medicine-men
in the intervals between chants applied this yellow powder to the
forehead of the patient, then in form of a cross upon his breast, then in
a circle around his couch, then upon the heads of the chanters and of
sympathizing friends, and lastly upon their own heads and into their
own mouths. There is a considerable difference in method, as medicine-men
allow themselves great latitude, or a large "personal equation,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
in all their dealings with the supernatural. No Apache would,
if it could be avoided, go on the warpath without a bag of this precious
powder somewhere upon his person, generally, as I have said, attached
to his ammunition belt. Whenever one was wounded, hurt, or taken
sick while on a scout, the medicine-man of the party would walk in
front of the horse or mule ridden by the patient and scatter at intervals
little pinches of hoddentin, that his path might be made easier. As
was said to me: "When we Apache go on the warpath, hunt, or plant,
we always throw a pinch of hoddentin to the sun, saying 'with the
favor of the sun, or permission of the sun, I am going out to fight,
hunt, or plant,' as the case may be, 'and I want the sun to help me.'"</p>

<p>I have noticed that the Apache, when worn out with marching, put
a pinch of hoddentin on their tongues as a restorative.</p>

remedy."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>"Before starting out on the warpath, they take a pinch of hoddentin,
throw it to the sun, and also put a pinch on their tongues and one on
the crown of the head.... When they return, they hold a
dance, and on the morning of that day throw pinches of hoddentin to
the rising sun, and then to the east, south, west, and north, to the four
winds."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>I am unable to assert that hoddentin is used in any way at the
birth of a child; but I know that as late as 1886 there was not a babe
upon the San Carlos reservation, no matter how tender its age, that did
not have a small bag of hoddentin attached to its neck or dangling
from its cradle. Neither can I assert anything about its use at time of
marriage, because, among the Apache, marriage is by purchase, and
attended with little, if any, ceremony. But when an Apache girl attains
the age of puberty, among other ceremonies performed upon her,
they throw hoddentin to the sun and strew it about her and drop on
her head flour of the pi√±on, which flour is called by the Chiricahua
Apache "nostchi," and by the Sierra Blanca Apache
"op√©."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

When an Apache dies, if a medicine-man
be near, hoddentin is sprinkled upon the corpse. The Apache
buried in the clefts of rocks, but the Apache-Mohave cremated. "Before
lighting the fire the medicine-men of the Apache-Mohave put hoddentin
on the dead person's breast in the form of a cross, on the forehead,
shoulders, and scattered a little
about."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The very first thing an Apache does in the morning is to blow a little
pinch of hoddentin to the dawn. The Apache worship both dawn
and darkness, as well as the sun, moon, and several of the planets.</p>

<p>In November, 1885, while at the San Carlos agency, I had an interview
with Nantadotash, an old blind medicine-man of the Aka√±e or
Willow gens, who had with him a very valuable medicine-hat which he
refused to sell, and only with great reluctance permitted me to touch.
Taking advantage of his infirmity, I soon had a picture drawn in my
notebook, and the text added giving the symbolism of all the ornamentation
attached. Upon discovering this, the old man became much
excited, and insisted upon putting a pinch of hoddentin upon the drawing,
and then recited a prayer, which I afterwards succeeded in getting
verbatim. After the prayer was finished, the old man arose and
marked with hoddentin the breast of his wife, of Moses, of Antonio,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
of other Apache present, and then of myself, putting a large pinch
over my heart and upon each shoulder, and then placed the rest upon
his own tongue. He explained that I had taken the "life" out of his
medicine hat, and, notwithstanding the powers of his medicine, returned
in less than a month with a demand for $30 as damages. His hat
never was the same after I drew it. My suggestion that the application
of a little soap might wash away the clots of grease, soot, and
earth adhering to the hat, and restore its pristine efficacy were received
with the scorn due to the sneers of the scoffer.</p>

</div>

<p>Tzit-jizinde, "the Man who likes Everybody," who said he belonged
to the Inoschujochin&mdash;Manzanita or Bearberry clan&mdash;showed me how
to pray with hoddentin in time of lightning or storm or danger of any
kind. Taking a small pinch in his fingers, he held it out at arm's
length, standing up, and repeated his prayer, and then blew his breath
hard. I was once with a party of Apache while a comet was visible. I
called their attention to it, but they did not seem to care. On the
other hand, Antonio told me that the "biggest dance" the Apache
ever had was during the time that "the stars all fell out of the sky"
(1833).</p>

<p>"The only act of a religious character which I observed ... was
shortly after crossing the river they [i.e., the American officers] were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
met by a small party of the Indians, one of whom chalked a cross on
the breast of each, with a yellow earth, which he carried in a satchel at
his belt. Previous to doing so he muttered some words very solemnly
with his hands uplifted and eyes thrown upwards. Again, on arriving
at the camp of the people, the chief and others in greeting them took
a similar vow, touching thereafter the yellow chalked cross. Sonora
may have furnished them with some of their notions of a
Deity."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>"The yellow earth," seen by Dr. Smart was, undoubtedly, hoddentin,
carried in a medicine bag at the belt of a medicine-man. Some years
ago I went out with Al. Seiber and a small party of Apache to examine
three of their "sacred caves" in the Sierra Pinal and Sierra Ancha. No
better opportunity could have been presented for noting what they did.
The very last thing at night they intoned a "medicine" song, and at early
dawn they were up to throw a pinch of hoddentin to the east.</p>

<p>Moses and John, two of the Apache mentioned above, requested permission
to go off in the mountains after deer and bear, supposed to be
plentiful in the higher altitudes. Before leaving camp, Moses blew a
pinch of hoddentin toward the sun, repeating his prayer for success,
and ending it with a sharp, snappy "ek," as if to call attention. In
one of the sacred caves visited on this trip, the Apache medicine-men
assembled for the purpose of holding their snake dance. This I have
never seen among the Apache, but that they celebrate it and that it is
fully the equal of the repulsive rite which I have witnessed and noted
among the Tusayan<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> I am fully assured. I may make reference to some
of its features in the chapter upon animal worship and ophic rites.</p>

<p>From a multiplicity of statements, the following are taken: Concepcion
had seen the snake dance over on the Carrizo, near Camp Apache;
the medicine-men threw hoddentin upon the snakes. He said: "After
getting through with the snake, the medicine-man suffered it to glide
off, covered with the hoddentin, thrown by admiring devotees."</p>

<p>Mike Burns had no remembrance of seeing hoddentin thrown to the
sun. He had seen it thrown to the snake, "in a kind of worship."</p>

<p>Nott and Antonio stated that "when they find that a snake has
wriggled across the trail, especially the trail to be followed by a war
party, they throw hoddentin upon the trail." Nott took a pinch of
hoddentin, showed how to throw it upon the snake, and repeated the
prayer, which I recorded.</p>

<p>Corbusier instances a remedy in use among the Tonto Apache. This
consisted in applying a rattlesnake to the head or other part suffering
from pain. He continues: "After a time the medicine-man rested the
snake on the ground again, and, still retaining his hold of it with his
right hand, put a pinch of yellow pollen into its mouth with his left,
and rubbed some along its
belly."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>
<p>"He then held his hand out to a man, who took a pinch of the powder
and rubbed it on the crown of a boy's head. Yellow pollen treated in
this manner is a common remedy for headache, and may frequently be
seen on the crowns of the heads of men and
boys."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Hoddentin is used in the same manner as a remedy for headache among
the San Carlos Apache, but the medicine-men apply a snake to the
person of a patient only when their "diagnosis" has satisfied them that
he has been guilty of some unkindness to a snake, such as stepping
upon it, in which case they pretend that they can cure the man by
applying to the part affected the portion of the reptile's body upon
which he trampled.</p>

<p>The Apache state that when their medicine-men go out to catch snakes
for their snake dance, they recite a prayer and lay their left hand, in
which is some hoddentin, at the opening of the snake's den, through
which the reptile must crawl, and, after a short time the snake will
come out and allow himself to be handled.</p>

<p>Hoddentin is also offered to other animals, especially the bear, of
which the Apache, like their congeners the Navajo, stand in great awe
and reverence. When a bear is killed, the dance which is held becomes
frenzied; the skin is donned by all the men, and much hoddentin is
thrown, if it can be obtained. One of these dances which I saw in the
Sierra Madre, Mexico, in 1883, lasted all night, without a moment's
cessation in the singing and prancing of the participants.</p>

<p>A great deal of hoddentin is offered to the "ka-chu" (great or jack
rabbit).<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The Apache medicine-man, Nakay-do-klunni, called by the whites
"Bobbydoklinny," exercised great influence over his people at Camp
Apache, in 1881. He boasted of his power to raise the dead, and predicted
that the whites should soon be driven from the land. He also
drilled the savages in a peculiar dance, the like of which had never been
seen among them. The participants, men and women, arranged themselves
in files, facing a common center, like the spokes of a wheel, and
while thus dancing hoddentin was thrown upon them in profusion.
This prophet or "doctor" was killed in the engagement in the Cibicu
canyon, August 30, 1881.</p>

<p>In a description of the "altars" made by the medicine-men of the
Apache-Yuma at or near Camp Verde, Arizona, it is shown that this
sacred powder is freely used. Figures were drawn upon the ground
to represent the deities of the tribe, and the medicine-men dropped on
all, except three of them, a pinch of yellow powder (hoddentin) which
was taken from a small buckskin bag. This powder was put upon the
head, chest, or other part of the body of the patient.</p>

<p>Surgeon Corbusier, U. S.
Army,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> says that the ceremony just described
was "a most sacred one and entered into for the purpose of averting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
diseases with which the Apache at Camp Verde had been afflicted the
summer previous."</p>

<p>I am not sure that the Apache-Yuma have not borrowed the use of
hoddentin from the Apache. My reason for expressing this opinion is
that I have never seen an Apache without a little bag of hoddentin
when it was possible for him to get it, whereas I have never seen an
Apache-Yuma with it except when he was about to start out on the
warpath. The "altars" referred to by Corbusier are made also by the
Apache, Navajo, Zu√±i, and Tusayan. Those of the Apache, as might be
inferred from their nomadic state, were the crudest; those of the Navajo,
Zu√±i, and Tusayan display a wonderful degree of artistic excellence.
The altars of the Navajo have been described and illustrated by Dr.
Washington Matthews,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
and those of the Tusayan by
myself.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Moses Henderson, wishing me to have a profitable interview with his
father, who was a great snake doctor among the Apache, told me that
when he brought him to see me I should draw two lines across each
other on his right foot, and at their junction place a bead of the chalchihuitl,
the cross to be drawn with hoddentin. The old man would
then tell me all he knew.</p>

<p>The Apache, I learned, at times offer hoddentin to fire, an example
of pyrodulia for which I had been on the lookout, knowing that the
Navajo have fire dances, the Zu√±i the Feast of the Little God of Fire,
and the Apache themselves are not ignorant of the fire dance.</p>

<p>Hoddentin seems to be used to strengthen all solemn compacts and
to bind faith. I had great trouble with a very bright medicine-man
named Na-a-cha, who obstinately refused to let me look at the contents
of a phylactery which he constantly wore until I let him know that I, too,
was a medicine-man of eminence. The room in which we had our conversation
was the quarters of the post surgeon, at that time absent on
scout. The chimney piece was loaded with bottles containing all kinds
of drugs and medicines. I remarked carelessly to Na-a-cha that if he
doubted my powers I would gladly burn a hole through his tongue with
a drop of fluid from the vial marked "Acid, nitric," but he concluded
that my word was sufficient, and after the door was locked to secure us
from intrusion he consented to let me open and examine the phylactery
and make a sketch of its contents. To guard against all possible
trouble, he put a pinch of hoddentin on each of my shoulders, on the
crown of my head, and on my chest and back. The same performance
was gone through with in his own case. He explained that hoddentin
was good for men to eat, that it was good medicine for the bear, and
that the bear liked to eat it. I thought that herein might be one clew
to the reason why the Apache used it as a medicine. The bear loves
the tule swamp, from which, in days primeval, he sallied out to attack
the squaws and children gathering the tule powder or tule bulb. Poorly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
armed, as they then were, the Apache must have had great trouble in
resisting him; hence they hope to appease him by offering a sacrifice
acceptable to his palate. If acceptable to the chief animal god, as the
bear seems to have been, as he certainly was the most dangerous, then
it would have been also acceptable to the minor deities like the puma,
snake, eagle, etc., and, by an easy transition, to the sun, moon, and
other celestial powers. This opinion did not last long, as will be shown.
From its constant association with all sacrifices and all acts of worship,
hoddentin would naturally become itself sanctified and an object of
worship, just as rattles, drums, standards, holy grails, etc., in different
parts of the world have become fetichistic. I was not in the least
surprised when I heard Moses Henderson reciting a prayer, part of
which ran thus: "Hoddentin eshkin, bi hoddentin ashi" ("Hoddentin
child, you hoddentin I offer"), and to learn that it was a personification
of hoddentin.</p>

<p>The fact that the myths of the Apache relate that Assanut-li-je
spilled hoddentin over the surface of the sky to make the Milky Way
may be looked upon as an inchoate form of a calendar, just as the
Aztecs transferred to their calendar the reed, rabbit, etc.</p>

<p>So constant is the appearance of hoddentin in ceremonies of a religious
nature among the Apache that the expression "hoddentin
schlawn" (plenty of hoddentin) has come to mean that a particular performance
or place is sacred. Yet, strange to say, this sacred pollen of
the tule is gathered without any special ceremony; at least, I noticed
none when I saw it gathered, although I should not fail to record that
at the time of which I speak the Apache and the Apache-Yuma were
returning from an arduous campaign, in which blood had been shed,
and everything they did&mdash;the bathing in the sweat lodges and the singing
of the Apache and the plastering of mud upon their heads by the
Apache-Yuma&mdash;had a reference to the lustration or purgation necessary
under such circumstances. Not only men but women may gather the
pollen. When the tule is not within reach our cat-tail rush is used.
Thus, the Chiricahua, confined at Fort Pickens, Florida, gathered the
pollen of the cat-tail rush, some of which was given me by one of the
women who gathered it.</p>

<p>Before making an examination into the meaning to be attached to the
use of hoddentin, it is well to determine whether or not such a powder
or anything analogous to it is to be found among the tribes adjacent.</p>


<h3>THE "KUNQUE" OF THE ZU√ëI AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p>The term "kunque" as it appears in this chapter is one of convenience
only. Each pueblo, or rather each set of pueblos, has its own name in
its own language, as, for example, the people of Laguna and Acoma,
who employ it in all their ceremonies as freely as do the Zu√±i, call
it in their tongue "hinawa." In every pueblo which I visited&mdash;and
I visited them all, from Oraibi of Tusayan, on the extreme west, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Picuris, on the extreme east; from Taos, in the far north, to Isleta del
Sur, in Texas&mdash;I came upon this kunque, and generally in such quantities
and so openly exposed and so freely used that I was both astonished
and gratified; astonished that after centuries of contact with the
Caucasian the natives should still adhere with such tenacity to the
ideas of a religion supposed to have been extirpated, and gratified to
discover a lever which I could employ in prying into the meaning of
other usages and ceremonials.</p>

<p>Behind the main door in the houses at Santa Clara, San Ildefonso,
Picuris, Laguna, Acoma, San Felipe, Jemez, and other towns, there is a
niche containing a bowl or saucer filled with this sacred meal, of which the
good housewife is careful to throw a pinch to the sun at early dawn and
to the twilight at eventide. In every ceremony among the Pueblos naturally
enough, more particularly among those who have been living farthest
from the Mexicans, the lavish scattering of sacred meal is the marked
feature of the occasion. At the snake dance of the Tusayan, in 1881,
the altars were surrounded with baskets of pottery and with flat
plaques of reeds, which were heaped high with kunque. When the
procession moved out from under the arcade and began to make the
round of the sacred stone the air was white with meal, and in my imagination
I could see that it was a procession of Druids circling about a
"sacred stone" in Ireland previous to the coming of St. Patrick. When
the priests threw the snakes down upon the ground it was within a
circle traced with kunque, and soon the snakes were covered with the
same meal flung upon them by the squaws. There was only one scalp
left among the Tusayan in 1881, but there were several among the Zu√±i,
and one or two each at Acoma and Laguna. In every one of these
towns kunque was offered to the scalps.</p>

<p>At the feast of the Little God of Fire among the Zu√±i, in 1881, my
personal notes relate that "the moment the head of the procession
touched the knoll upon which the pueblo is built the mass of people
began throwing kunque upon the Little God and those with him as well
as on the ground in front of, beside, and behind them. This kunque
was contained in sacred basket-shaped bowls of earthenware. The
spectators kept the air fairly misty with clouds of the sacred kunque.
This procession passed around the boundaries of the pueblo of Zu√±i,
stopping at eight holes in the ground for the purpose of enacting a ceremonial
of consecration suggestive of the 'terminalia' of the Romans.
They visited each of the holes, which were 18 inches deep and 12 inches
square, with a sandstone slab to serve as a cover. Each hole was filled
with kunque and sacrificial plumes. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;'Every morning of the year,
when the sky is clear, at the rising of Lucero [the morning star], at the
crowing of the cock, we throw corn flour [kunque] to the sun. I am never
without my bag of kunque; here it is [drawing it from his belt]. Every
Zu√±i has one. We offer it to the sun for good rain and good
crops.'"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>
<p>Subsequently Pedro went on to describe in detail a phallic dance and
ceremony, in which there was a sort of divination. The young maiden
who made the lucky guess was richly rewarded, while her less fortunate
companions were presented with a handful of kunque, which they kept
during the ensuing year. This dance is called "ky'√°klu," and is independent
of the great phallic dance occurring in the month of December.
Pedro also stated that until very recently the Zu√±i were in the habit of
celebrating a fire dance at Noche Buena (Christmas). There were four
piles of wood gathered for the occasion, and upon each the medicine-men
threw kunque in profusion. This dance, as Pedro described it,
closely resembled one mentioned by Landa in his Cosas de Yucatan.
High up on the vertical face of the precipice of T√¢aiyalana there is a
phallic shrine of the Zu√±i to which I climbed with Mr. Frank Cushing.
We found that the place had been visited by young brides who were
desirous of becoming mothers. The offerings in every case included
kunque.</p>

<p>In the account given in the National Tribune, Washington, District of
Columbia, May 20, 1886, of the mode of life of the Zu√±i woman Wehwa
while in the national capital, and while engaged in the kirmes, we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>She also strewed sacred corn meal along on her way to the theater to bring good
luck to her and the other dancers. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;She has gone from her comfortable room
to pray in the street at daylight every morning, whatever the weather has been.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;At such times she strews corn meal all around her until the front-door steps
and the sidewalk are much daubed with dough. But this is not the corn meal in
common use in the United States, but is sacred meal ground in Zu√±i with sacred
stones.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So long a time has elapsed since any of the Pueblos have been on the
warpath that no man can describe their actual war customs except from
the dramatic ceremonial of their dances or from the stories told him by
the "old men." The following from an eyewitness will therefore be of
interest: "Before the Pueblos reached the heights they were ordered to
scale they halted on the way to receive from their chiefs some medicine
from the medicine bags which each of them carried about his person.
This they rubbed upon their heart, as they said, to make it big and
brave, and they also rubbed it upon other parts of their bodies and
upon their rifles for the same
purpose."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The constant use of kunque by the different Pueblo tribes has been
noticed from the first days of European contact. In the relation of
Don Antonio de Espejo (1583) we are told that upon the approach of
the Spaniards to the town of Zaguato, lying 28 leagues west of Zu√±i,
"a great multitude of Indians came forth to meete them, and among the
rest their Ca√ßiques, with so great demonstration of joy and gladnes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
that they cast much meale of Maiz upon the ground for the horses to
tread upon."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>I am under the impression that the ruins of this village are those near
the ranch of Mr. Thomas V. Keam, at Keam's Canyon, Arizona, called
by the Navajo "Talla-hogandi," meaning "singing house," in reference
to the Spanish mission which formerly existed there. This village is,
as I have hitherto shown, the ruin of the early pueblo of Aw√°tubi.</p>

<p>In his poem descriptive of the conquest of New Mexico, entitled
"Nueva Mejico," Alcala de Henares, 1610, Villagr√° uses the following

<p>It is gratifying to observe that the Spanish writer in the remote wilds
of America struck upon an important fact in ethnology: that the throwing
of "harina" or flour by the people of Tusayan (Moho√ße or Moqui),
Cibola, and Zu√±i (observe the odd separation of "Zibola" from either
Moqui or Zu√±i) was identical with the "carnestolendas" of Spain, in
which, on Shrove Tuesday, the women and girls cover all the men they
meet with flour. The men are not at all backward in returning the
compliment, and the streets are at times filled with the farinaceous dust.</p>

<p>"Harina de maiz azul" is used by Mexicans in their religious ceremonies,
especially those connected with the water
deities.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The Peruvians,

We are at a loss to know what this powder was, unless hoddentin. The
Indians came down to receive the son of the sun, as Alarcon led them to
believe him to be, in full gala attire, and no doubt neglected nothing
that would add to their safety.</p>

<p>In Yucatan, when children were baptized, one of the ceremonies
was that the chac, or priest in charge, should give the youngster a

<p>When Capt. John Smith was captured by the Pamunkey tribe of Virginia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
in 1607 he was taken to "a long house," where, on the morning following
"a great grim fellow" came skipping in, "all painted over with
coale, mingled with oyle. With most strange gestures and passions he
began his invocation, and environed the fire with a circle of meale."
This priest was followed by six others, who "with their rattles began
a song, which ended, the chiefe priest layd downe five wheat cornes."
This ceremony was apparently continued during the day and repeated
on the following two days.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>

<p>Maj. Backus, U. S. Army, describes certain ceremonies which he saw

which seems to have once been a geyser:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>I once visited it with three other persons and an Indian doctor, who carried with
him five small bags, each containing some vegetable or mineral substance, all differing
in color. At the spring each bag was opened and a small quantity of its contents was
put into the right hand of each person present. Each visitor, in succession, was then
required to kneel down by the spring side, to place his closed hand in the water up
to his elbow, and after a brief interval to open his hand and let fall its contents
into the spring. The hand was then slowly withdrawn and each one was then permitted
to drink and retire.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Columbus in his fourth voyage touched the mainland, going down
near Brazil. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Cariay and the neighboring country there are great enchanters of a very fearful
character. They would have given the world to prevent my remaining there an hour.
When I arrived they sent me immediately two girls very showily dressed; the eldest
could not be more than eleven years of age and the other seven, and both exhibited
so much immodesty that more could not be expected from public women. They
carried concealed about them a magic

blowing out his breath, he spoke to it, invoking success in hunting. The
moon, he said, was 'Tyunne,' or ruler of deers, bears, seals, and walrus."
The ceremony herein described I have no doubt was analogous in
every respect to hoddentin-throwing. As the Indians mentioned were

<p>The women of the East Indies (Brahmins), on the 18th of January,
celebrate a feast in honor of the goddess Parvati: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leur but est d'obtenir

<p>Speaking of the methods in use among the Lamas for curing disease,
Rev. James Gilmour says: "Throwing about small pinches of millet seed
is a usual part of such a
service."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Dr. W. W. Rockhill described to me a Tibetan festival, which includes
a procession of the God of Mercy, in which procession there are
masked priests, holding blacksnake whips in their hands, and carrying
bags of flour which they throw upon the people.</p>

<p>The use of these sacred powders during so many different religious
festivals and ceremonies would seem to resemble closely that made by
the Apache of hoddentin and the employment of kunque by the Zu√±i
and others; and from Asia it would seem that practices very similar
in character found their way into Europe. Of the Spanish witches it
is related:</p>

<blockquote><p>When they entered people's houses they threw a powder on the faces of the inmates,
who were thrown thereby into so deep a slumber that nothing could wake them, until
the witches were gone.... Sometimes they threw these powders on the
fruits of the field and produced hail which destroyed them. On these occasions the
demon accompanied them in the form of a husbandman, and when they threw the
powders they said:</p>

<div class="cpoem1" lang="es" xml:lang="es"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Polvos, polvos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierda se tado,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queden los nuestros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y abrasense
otros."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>
<p>Higgins says: "The flour of wheat was the sacrifice offered to the
<i>&#935;&#961;&#951;&#962;</i> or Ceres in the
<i>&#917;&#8016;&#967;&#8112;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#945;</i>."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>What relation these powders have had to the "carnestolendas" of
the Spanish and Portuguese, already alluded to, and the throwing of
"confetti" by the Italians, which is a modification, it would be hard to
say. Some relation would appear to be suggested.</p>


<h3>USE OF POLLEN BY THE ISRAELITES AND EGYPTIANS.</h3>

<p>There are some suggestions of a former use of pollen among the
Israelites and Egyptians.</p>

<p>Manna, which we are assured was at one time a source of food to
the Hebrews, was afterward retained as an offering in the temples.
Forlong, however, denies that it ever could have entered into general
consumption. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Manna, as food, is an absurdity, but we have the well-known produce of the desert
oak or ash&mdash;Fraxinus.... An omer of this was precious, and in this
quantity, at the spring season, not difficult to get; it was a specially fit tribute to
be "laid up" before any Phallic Jah, as it was the pollen of the tree of Jove and of
Life, and in this sense the tribe lived spiritually on such "spiritual manna" as this
god supplied or was supplied
with.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The detestation in which the bean was held by the high-caste people
of Egypt does not demonstrate that the bean was not an article of food
to a large part of the population, any more than the equal detestation
of the occupation of swineherd would prove that none of the poor
made use of swine's flesh. The priesthood of Egypt were evidently
exerting themselves to stamp out the use of a food once very common
among their people, and to supersede it with wheat or some other
cereal. They held a man accursed who in passing through a field
planted with beans had his clothing soiled with their pollen. Speke
must have encountered a survival of this idea when he observed in
equatorial Africa, near the sources of the Nile, and among people whose
features proclaimed their Abyssinian origin, the very same aversion.
He was unable to buy food, simply because he and some of his followers
had eaten "the bean called maharag&#365;√©." Such a man, the natives
believed, "if he tasted the products of their cows, would destroy their
cattle."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>One other point should be dwelt upon in describing the kunque of
the Zu√±i, Tusayan, and other Pueblos. It is placed upon one of the
sacred flat baskets and packed down in such a manner that it takes
the form of one of the old-fashioned elongated cylindro-conical cheeses.
It should be noted also that by something more than a coincidence this
form was adhered to by the peoples farther to the south when they arranged
their sacred meal upon baskets.</p>

<p>At the festival of the god Teutleco the Aztecs made "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">de harina de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
maiz un montecillo muy tupido de la forma de un
queso</span>."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This closely
resembles the corn meal heaps seen at the snake dance of the Tusayan.</p>

<p>The Zu√±i, in preparing kunque or sacred meal for their religious
festivals, invariably made it in the form of a pyramid resting upon one
of their flat baskets. It then bore a striking resemblance to the pyramids
or phalli which the Egyptians offered to their deities, and which
Forlong thinks must have been "just such Lingham-like sweet-bread
as we still see in Indian Sivaic
temples."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
Again, "the orthodox Hislop,
in his Two Babylons, tells us that 'bouns,' buns, or bread offered
to the gods from the most ancient times were similar to our 'hotcross'
buns of Good Friday, that ... the buns known by that identical
name were used in the worship of the Queen of Heaven, the goddess
Easter (Ishtar or Astarti) as early as the days of Kekrops, the founder
of Athens, 1500 years B. C."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Forlong<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
quotes Capt. Wilford in Asiatick Researches, vol. 8, p. 365, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the people of Syracuse were sacrificing to goddesses, they offered cakes
called <i>mulloi</i>, shaped like the female organ; and Dulare tells us that the male organ
was similarly symbolised in pyramidal cakes at Easter by the pious Christians of
Saintogne, near Rochelle, and handed about from house to house; that even in his
day the festival of Palm Sunday was called <i>La F√™te des Pinnes</i>, showing that this f√™te
was held to be on account of both organs, although, of course, principally because
the day was sacred to the palm, the ancient tree Phallus.... We may believe
that the Jewish cakes and show bread were also emblematic.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Frank H. Cushing informs me that there is an annual feast among
the Zu√±i in which are to be seen cakes answering essentially to the
preceding description.</p>


<h3>HODDENTIN A PREHISTORIC FOOD.</h3>

<p>The peculiar manner in which the medicine-men of the Apache use the
hoddentin (that is, by putting a pinch upon their own tongues); the fact
that men and women make use of it in the same way, as a restorative when
exhausted; its appearance in myth in connection with Assanutlije, the
goddess who supplied the Apache and Navajo with so many material
benefits, all combine to awaken the suspicion that in hoddentin we
have stumbled upon a prehistoric food now reserved for sacrificial purposes
only. That the underlying idea of sacrifice is a food offered to
some god is a proposition in which Herbert Spencer and W. Robertson
Smith concur. In my opinion, this definition is incomplete; a perfect
sacrifice is that in which a <i>prehistoric</i> food is offered to a god, and,
although in the family oblations of everyday life we meet with the
food of the present generation, it would not be difficult to show that
where the whole community unites in a function of exceptional importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
the propitiation of the deities will be effected by foods whose use
has long since faded away from the memory of the laity.</p>

<p>The sacred feast of stewed puppy and wild turnips forms a prominent
part of the sun dance of the Sioux, and had its parallel in a collation
of boiled puppy (catullus), of which the highest civic and ecclesiastical
dignitaries of pagan Rome partook at stated intervals.</p>

<p>The reversion of the Apache to the food of his ancestors&mdash;the hoddentin&mdash;as
a religious offering has its analogue in the unleavened bread
and other obsolete farinaceous products which the ceremonial of more
enlightened races has preserved from oblivion. Careful consideration
of the narrative of Cabeza de Vaca sustains this conclusion. In the
western portion of his wanderings we learn that for from thirty to forty
days he and his comrades passed through tribes which for one-third
of the year had to live on "the powder of straw" (on the powder of
bledos), and that afterwards the Spaniards came among people who
raised corn. At that time, Vaca, whether we believe that he ascended
the Rio Concho or kept on up the Rio Grande, was in a region where
he would certainly have encountered the ancestors of our Apache tribe
and their brothers the Navajo. The following is Herrera's account of
that part of Vaca's wanderings: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Padeciendo mucha hambre en
treinta i quatro Jornadas, pasando por una Gente que la tercera parte
del A√±o comen polvos de paja, i los huvieron de comer, por haver llegado
en tal ocasion.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>This powder (polvo) of paja or grass might at first sight seem to be
grass seeds; but why not say "flour," as on other occasions? The phrase
is an obscure one, but not more obscure than the description of the
whole journey. In the earlier writings of the Spaniards there is ambiguity
because the new arrivals endeavored to apply the names of their
own plants and animals to all that they saw in the western continent.
Neither Casta√±eda nor Cabeza de Vaca makes mention of hoddentin,
but Vaca does say that when he had almost ended his journey:
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La c√¥te ne poss√®de pas de ma√Øs; on n'y mange que de la poudre de
paille de blette.</span>" "Blette" is the same as the Spanish
"bledos."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous
parv√Ænmes chez une peuplade qui, pendant le tiers de l'ann√©e, ne vit que
de poudre de paille.</span>" "We met with a people, who the third part of
the yeere eate no other thing save the powder of
straw."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Davis, who seems to have followed Herrera, says: "These Indians
lived one-third of the year on the powder of a certain straw....
After leaving this people they again arrived in a country of permanent
habitations, where they found an abundance of maize....
The inhabitants gave them maize both in grain and
flour."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>The Tusayan Indians were formerly in the habit of adding a trifle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
chopped straw to their bread, but more as our own bakers would use
bran than as a regular article of diet.</p>

<p>Barcia<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
makes no allusion to anything resembling hoddentin or "polvos
de bledos" in his brief account of Vaca's journey. But Buckingham
Smith, in his excellent translation of Vaca's narrative, renders "polvos
de paja" thus: "It was probably the seed of grass which they ate. I
am told by a distinguished explorer that the Indians to the west collect
it of different kinds and from the powder make bread, some of which
is quite palatable." And for "polvos de bledos": "The only explanation
I can offer for these words is little satisfactory. It was the practice
of the Indians of both New Spain and New Mexico to beat the ear
of young maize, while in the milk, to a thin paste, hang it in festoons in
the sun, and, being thus dried, was preserved for winter use."</p>

<p>This explanation is very unsatisfactory. Would not Vaca have
known it was corn and have said so? On the contrary, he remarks in
that very line in Smith's own translation: "There is no maize on the
coast."</p>

<p>The appearance of all kinds of grass seeds in the food of nearly all
the aborigines of our southwestern territory is a fact well known, but
what is to be demonstrated is the extensive use of the "powder" of the
tule or cat-tail rush. Down to our day, the Apache have used not only
the seeds of various grasses, but the bulb of the wild hyacinth and the
bulb of the tule. The former can be eaten either raw or cooked, but
the tule bulb is always roasted between hot stones. The taste of the
hyacinth bulb is somewhat like that of raw chestnuts. That of the
roasted tule bulb is sweet and not at all
disagreeable.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Father Jacob Baegert<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
enumerates among the foods of the Indians of
southern California "the roots of the common reed" (i.e., of the tule).</p>

<p>Father Alegre, speaking of the tribes living near the Laguna San
Pedro,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
in latitude 28¬∞ north&mdash;two hundred leagues north of the City of
Mexico&mdash;says that they make their bread of the root, which is very
frequent in their lakes, and which is like the plant called the "anea"
or rush in Spain. "Forman el pan de una raiz muy frecuente en sus
lagunas, semejante √° las que llaman aneas en
Espa√±a."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>The Indians of the Atlantic Slope made bread of the bulb of a plant
which Capt. John Smith<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
says "grew like a flag in marshes." It was
roasted and made into loaves called
"tuckahoe."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Kalm, in his Travels in North
America,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
says of the tuckahoe:</p>

<blockquote><p>It grows in several swamps and marshes and is commonly plentiful. The hogs
greedily dig up its roots with their noses in such places, and the Indians of Carolina
likewise gather it in their rambles in the woods, dry it in the sun, grind, and make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
bread of it. Whilst the root is fresh it is harsh and acrid, but, being dried, it loses
the greater part of its acrimony. To judge by these qualities, the tuckahoe may
very likely be the Arum virginianum.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Shoshoni and Bannock of Idaho and Montana eat the tule
bulb.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Something analogous to hoddentin is mentioned by the chronicler of
Drake's voyage along the California coast about A. D. 1540. Speaking
of the decorations of the chiefs of the Indians seen near where San
Francisco now stands, he says another mark of distinction was "a certain
downe, which groweth up in the countrey upon an herbe much like
our lectuce, which exceeds any other downe in the world for finenesse
and beeing layed upon their cawles, by no winds can be removed. Of
such estimation is this herbe amongst them that the downe thereof is
not lawfull to be worne, but of such persons as are about the king,
... and the seeds are not used but onely in sacrifice to their
gods."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cushing informs me that hoddentin is mentioned as a food in the
myths of the Zu√±i under the name of oneya, from oellu, "food."</p>

<p>In Kamtchatka the people dig and cook the bulbs of the Kamtchatka
lily, which seems to be some sort of a tuber very similar to that of the
tule.</p>

<p>"Bread is now made of rye, which the Kamtchadals raise and grind
for themselves; but previous to the settlement of the country by the
Russians the only native substitute for bread was a sort of baked paste,
consisting chiefly of the grated tubers of the purple Kamtchatkan
lily."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>


<h3>HODDENTIN THE YIAUHTLI OF THE AZTECS.</h3>

<p>There would seem to be the best of reason for an identification of
hoddentin with the "yiauhtli" which Sahagun and Torquemada tell
us was thrown by the Aztecs in the faces of victims preparatory to sacrificing
them to the God of Fire, but the explanation given by those
authors is not at all satisfactory. The Aztecs did not care much whether
the victim suffered or not; he was sprinkled with this sacred powder
because he had assumed a sacred character.</p>

<p>Padre Sahagun<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
says that the Aztecs, when about to offer human
sacrifice, threw "a powder named 'yiauhtli' on the faces of those whom
they were about to sacrifice, that they might become deprived of sensation
and not suffer much pain in dying."</p>

<p>In sacrificing slaves to the God of Fire, the Aztec priests "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tomaban
ciertos polvos de una semilla, llamada Yauhtli, y polvoreaban las caras
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
con ellas, para que perdiesen el sentido, y no sintiesen tanto la muerte
cruel, que las daban</span>."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Guautli, generally spelled "yuautli," one of the foods paid to Montezuma
as tribute, may have been tule pollen. Gallatin says: "I can not
discover what is meant by the guautli. It is interpreted as being <i>semilla
de Bledo</i>; but I am not aware of any other native grain than maize
having been, before the introduction of European cereales, an article
of food of such general use, as the quantity mentioned seems to
indicate."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Among the articles which the king of Atzapotzalco compelled the
Aztecs to raise for tribute is mentioned "ahuauhtli (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">que es como
bledos</span>)."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>


<h3>"BLEDOS" OF ANCIENT WRITERS&mdash;ITS MEANING.</h3>

<p>Lafitau<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> gives a description of the Iroquois mode of preparing for
the warpath. He says that the Iroquois and Huron called war
"n'ondoutagette" and "gaskenragette." "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le terme <i>Ondouta</i> signifie
le duvet qu'on tire de l'√©py des Roseaux de Marais &amp; signifie aussi la
plante toute entiere, dont ils se servent pour faire les nattes sur quoi ils
couchent, de sorte qu'il y a apparence qu'ils avoient affect√© ce terme
pour la Guerre, parce que chaque Guerrier portoit avec soy sa natte
dans ces sortes d'expeditions.</span>"</p>

<p>This does not seem to be the correct explanation. Rather, it was
because they undoubtedly made some sacrificial meal of this "duvet,"
or pollen, and used it as much as the Apache do hoddentin, their
sacred meal made of the pollen of the tule, which is surely a species
of "roseaux de marais."</p>

<p>The great scarcity of corn among the people passed while en route
to Cibola is commented upon in an account of Coronado's expedition
to Cibola, in <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Coleccion de Documentos In√©ditos, relativos al descubrimiento,
conquista y colonizacion de las posesiones Espa√±olas de
Am√©rica y Ocean√≠a</span>.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>We are also informed<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
that the people of Cibola offered to their idols
"polbos amarillos de flores."</p>

<p>Casta√±eda speaks of the people beyond Chichilticale making a bread
of the mesquite which kept good for a whole year. He seems to have
been well informed regarding the vegetable foods of the tribes passed
through by Coronado's
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>That the "blettes" or "bledos" did not mean the same as grass is a
certainty after we have examined the old writers, who each and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
show that the bledos meant a definite kind of plant, although exactly
what this plant was they fail to inform us. It can not be intended for
the sunflower, which is mentioned distinctly by a number of writers as
an article of diet among the Indians of the
Southwest.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>


<h3>TZOALLI.</h3>

<p>An examination of the Spanish writers who most carefully transmitted
their observations upon the religious ceremonies of the Aztecs and
other nations in Mexico and South America brings out two most interesting
features in this connection. The first is that there were
commemorative feasts of prehistoric foods, and the second that one or
more of these foods has played an important part in the religion of
tribes farther north. The first of these foods is the "tzoalli," which was
the same as "bledos," which latter would seem beyond question to have
been hoddentin or yiauhtli. Brasseur de Bourbourg's definition simply
states that the tzoalli was a compound of leguminous grains peculiar
to Mexico and eaten in different ways: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Tzohualli √©tait un
compos√© de graines l√©gumineuses particuli√®res au Mexique, qu'on mangeait
de diverses mani√®res.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In the month called Tepeilhuitl the Aztecs made snakes of twigs and
covered them with dough of bledos (a kind of grain or hay seed).
Upon these they placed figures, representing mountains, but shaped
like young children.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
This month was the thirteenth on the Mexican
calendar, which began on our February 1. This would put it October
1, or thereabout.</p>

<p>Squier cites Torquemada's description of the sacrifices called Ecatotontin,
offered to the mountains by the Mexicans. In these they made
figures of serpents and children and covered them with "dough,"
named by them tzoalli, composed of the seeds of
bledos.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>A dramatic representation strongly resembling those described in
the two preceding paragraphs was noted among the Tusayan of Arizona
by Mr. Taylor, a missionary, in 1881, and has been mentioned at
length in The Snake Dance of the Moquis. Clavigero relates that
the Mexican priests "all eat a certain kind of gruel which they call
<i>Etzalli</i>."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Torquemada relates that the Mexicans once each year made an idol
or statue of Huitzlipotchli of many grains and the seeds of bledos and
other vegetables which they kneaded with the blood of boys who were
sacrificed for the purpose. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Juntaban muchos granos y semilla de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
Bledos, y otras legumbres, y molianlas con mucha devocion, y recato, y
de ellas amasaban, y formaban la dicha Estatua, del tama√±o y estatura
de un Hombre. El licor, con que se resolbian y desleian aquellas harinas
era sangre de Ni√±os, que para este fin se
sacrificaban.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable the word "maiz" does not occur in this paragraph.
Huitzlipotchli being the God of War, it was natural that the ritual
devoted to his service should conserve some, if not all, of the foods,
grains, and seeds used by the Mexicans when on the warpath in the
earliest days of their history; and that this food should be made into a
dough with the blood of children sacrificed as a preliminary to success
is also perfectly in accordance with all that we know of the mode of
reasoning of this and other primitive peoples. Torquemada goes on to
say that this statue was carried in solemn procession to the temple
and idol of Huitzlipotchli and there adorned with precious jewels
(chalchihuitl), embedded in the soft mass. Afterward it was carried to
the temple of the god Paynalton, preceded by a priest carrying a
snake in the manner that the priests in Spain carried the cross in the
processions of the church. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Con una Culebra mui grande, y
gruesa en las manos, tortuosa, y con muchas bueltas, que iba delante,
levantada en alto, √° manera de Cruz, en nuestras
Procesiones.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> This
dough idol, he says, was afterwards broken into "migajas" (crumbs)
and distributed among the males only, boys as well as men, and by
them eaten after the manner of communion; "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">este era su manera de
comunion</span>."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Herrera, speaking of this same idol of Vitzliputzli, as he
calls him, says it was made by the young women of the temple, of the
flour of bledos and of toasted maize, with honey, and that the eyes
were of green, white, or blue beads, and the teeth of grains of corn.
After the feast was over, the idol was broken up and distributed to the
faithful, "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">√° manera de comunion." "Las Doncellas recogidas en el
templo, dos Dias antes de la Fiesta, amasaban harina de Bledos, i de
Maiz tostado, con miel, y de la masa hacian un Idolo grande, con los
ojos de cuentas grandes, verdes, a√ßules, √≤ blancas; i por dientes granos
de maiz.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>H. H. Bancroft speaks of the festival in honor of Huitzilopochtli,
"the festival of the wafer or cake." He says: "They made a cake of
the meal of bledos, which is called tzoalli," which was afterward divided
in a sort of communion.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
Diego Duran remarks that at this feast the
chief priest carried an idol of dough called "tzoally," which is made of
the seeds of bledos and corn made into a mass with
honey.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">"Un
ydolo de masa, de una masa que llaman tzoally, la cual se hace de
semilla de bledos y maiz amasado con miel.</span>" This shows that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
"bledos" and "maiz" were different
things.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
A few lines farther on
Duran tells us that this cake, or bread, was made by the nuns of the
temple, "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">las mozas del recogimiento de este templo</span>," and that they
ground up a great quantity of the seed of bledos, which they call
huauhtly, together with toasted maize. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Molian mucha cantidad de
semilla de bledos que ellos llaman huauhtly juntamente con maiz
tostado.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
He then shows that the "honey" (miel) spoken of by the
other writers was the thick juice of the maguey. "Despues de molido,
amasabanlo con miel negra de los magueis."</p>

<p>Acosta describes a Mexican feast, held in our month of May, in which
appeared an idol called Huitzlipotchli, made of "mays rosty," "semence
de blettes," and "amassoient avec du
miel."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>In the above citations it will be seen that huauhtly or yuauhtli and
tzoally were one and the same. We also find some of the earliest if not
the very earliest references to the American popped corn.</p>

<p>That the Mexicans should have had such festivals or feasts in honor
of their god of battles is no more extraordinary than that in our own
country all military reunions make it a point to revert to the "hard
tack" issued during the campaigns in Virginia and Tennessee. Many
other references to the constant use as a food, or at least as a sacrificial
food, of the bledos might be supplied if needed. Thus Diego Duran
devotes the twelfth chapter of his third book to an obscure account of
a festival among the Tepanecs, in which appeared animal gods made
of "masa de semilla de bledos," which were afterwards broken and
eaten.</p>

<p>Torquemada speaks of such idols employed in the worship of snakes
and mountains.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
In still another place this authority tells us that similar
figures were made and eaten by bride and groom at the Aztec
marriage ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The ceremonial manner in which these seeds were ground recalls the
fact that the Zu√±i regard the stones used for grinding kunque as sacred
and will not employ them for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Idols made of dough much after the fashion of the Aztecs are to be
found among the Mongols. Meignan speaks of seeing "an idol, quite
open to the sky and to the desert, representing the deity of travelers.
It was made of compressed bread, covered over with some bituminous
substance, and perched on a horse of the same material, and held in its
hand a lance in Don Quixote attitude. Its horrible features were surmounted
with a shaggy tuft of natural hair. A great number of offerings
of all kinds were scattered on the ground all around. Five or six
images, formed also of bread, were bending in an attitude of prayer
before the deity."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Edwin James, the editor of Tanner's
Narrative,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> cites the "Calica
Puran" to show that medicinal images are employed by the people of
the East Indies when revenge is sought upon an enemy; "water must
be sprinkled on the meal or earthen victim which represents the sacrificer's
enemy."</p>

<p>In those parts of India where human sacrifice had been abolished, a
substitutive ceremony was practiced "by forming a human figure of
flour-paste, or clay, which they carry into the temples, and there cut
off its head or mutilate it, in various ways, in presence of the
idols."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Gomara describes the festival in honor of the Mexican God of Fire,
called "Xocothuecl," when an idol was used made of every kind of
seed and was then enwrapped in sacred blankets to keep it from breaking.
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hacian aquella noche un √≠dolo de toda suerte de semillas, envolv√≠anlo
en mantas benditas, y li√°banlo, porque no se
deshiciese.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>These blessed blankets are also to be seen at the Zu√±i feast of the
Little God of Fire, which occurs in the month of December. It is a
curious thing that the blessed blankets of the Zu√±i are decorated with
the butterfly, which appeared upon the royal robes of Montezuma.</p>

<p>What other seeds were used in the fabrication of these idols is not
very essential to our purpose, but it may be pointed out that one of
them was the seed of the "agenjo," which was the "chenopodium" or
"artemisia," known to us as the "sagebrush."</p>

<p>Of the Mexicans we learn from a trustworthy author: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tambien
usaban alguna manera de comunion √≥ recepcion del sacramento, y es
que hacian unos idolitos chiquitos de semilla de bledos √≥ cenizos, √≥ de

"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">al tiempo que yo esto escribo</span>."</p>

<p>The Mexicans, in the month of November, had a festival in honor of
Tezcatlipuca. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hacian unos bollos de masa de ma√≠z y semejante de
agenjos, aunque son de otra suerte que los de ac√°, y ech√°banlos √° cocer
en ollas con agua sola. Entre tanto que hervian y se cocian los bollos,

gran devocion.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Gomara's statement, that while these cakes of maize and wormwood
seed were cooking the young men were beating on drums, would find
its parallel in any account that might be written of the behavior of the
Zu√±i, while preparing for their sacred feasts. The squaws grind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
meal to be used on these occasions to the accompaniment of singing by
the medicine-men and much drumming by a band of assistants selected
from among the young men and boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis La Fl√®che, a nearly full-blood Omaha Indian, read before
the Anthropological Society of Washington, D. C., in 1888, a paper
descriptive of the funeral customs of his people, in which he related that
when an Indian was supposed to be threatened with death the medicine-men
would go in a lodge sweat-bath with him and sing, and at the
same time "pronouncing certain incantations and sprinkling the body
of the client with the powder of the artemisia, supposed to be the food
of the ghosts."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>To say that a certain powder is the food of the ghosts of a tribe is to
say indirectly that the same powder was once the food of the tribe's
ancestors.</p>

<p>The Peruvians seem to have made use of the same kind of sacrificial
cakes kneaded with the blood of the human victim. We are told that
in the month of January no strangers were allowed to enter the city of
Cuzco, and that there was then a distribution of corn cakes made with
the blood of the victim, which were to be eaten as a mark of alliance
with the Inca. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Les daban unos Bollos de Ma√≠z, con sangre de el
sacrificio, que comian, en se√±al de confederacion con el
Inga.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Balboa says that the Peruvians had a festival intended to signalize
the arrival of their young men at manhood, in which occurred a sort of
communion consisting of bread kneaded by the young virgins of the
sun with the blood of victims. This same kind of communion was also
noted at another festival occurring in our month of September of each
year. ("<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un festin compos√© de pain p√©tri par les jeunes vierges du
Soleil avec le sang des
victimes.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>)
There were other ceremonial usages
among the Aztecs, in which the tule rush itself, "espada√±a," was
employed, as at childbirth, marriage, the festivals in honor of Tlaloc,
and in the rough games played by boys. It is possible that from being
a prehistoric food the pollen of the tule, or the plant which furnished
it, became associated with the idea of sustenance, fertility, reproduction,
and therefore very properly formed part of the ritual necessary in weddings
or connected with the earliest hours of a child's life, much as rice
has been used so freely in other parts of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Among the Aztecs the newly born babe was laid upon fresh green tule
rushes, with great ceremony, while its name was given to
it.<a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Gomara says that the mats used in the marriage ceremonies of the
Aztecs were made of tules. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Esteras verdes de
espada√±as.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>"They both sat down upon a new and curiously wrought mat, which
was spread in the middle of the chamber close to the fire." The marriage
bed was made "of mats of rushes, covered with small sheets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
with certain feathers, and a gem of chalchihuitl in the middle of
them."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The third festival of Tlaloc was celebrated in the sixth month, which
would about correspond to our 6th of
June.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
But there was another
festival in honor of the Tlaloc, which seems very hard to understand.
A full description is given by
Bancroft.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
To celebrate this it was incumbent
upon the priests to cut and carry to the temples bundles of the
tule, which were woven into a sacred mat, after which there was a ceremonial
procession to a tule swamp in which all bathed.</p>

<p>The Aztecs, like the Apache, had myths showing that they sprang
originally from a reed swamp. There was an Aztec god, Napatecutli,
who was the god of the tule and of the
mat-makers.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
This rush was
also strewn as part of several of their religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>Fosbrooke<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
has this to say about certain ceremonies in connection with
the churches in Europe: "At certain seasons the Choir was strewed with
hay, at others with sand. On Easter sabbath with ivy-leaves; at other
times with rushes." He shows that hay was used at Christmas and
the vigil of All Saints, at Pentecost, Athelwold's Day, Assumption of
the Blessed Virgin, and Ascension, etc.</p>

<p>The Mexican populace played a game closely resembling our "blind
man's buff" in their seventeenth month, which was called Tititl and
corresponded to the winter solstice. In this game, called "nechichiquavilo,"
men and boys ran through the streets hitting every one whom
they met with small bags or nets ("taleguillas √≥ redecillas") filled with
tule powder or fine paper ("<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">llenas de flor de las espada√±as √≥ de algunos
papeles rotos</span>").<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>The same thing is narrated by other early Spanish writers upon
Mexico.</p>

<p>In the myths of Guatemala it is related that there were several distinct
generations of men. The first were made of wood, without heart
or brains, with worm-eaten feet and hands. The second generation
was an improvement upon this, and the women are represented as made
of tule. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las mugeres fueron hechas de corazon de
espada√±a.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Picart, enumerating the tree gods of the Romans, says that they had
deified "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Roseaux pour les
Rivieres</span>."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>


<h3>GENERAL USE OF THE POWDER AMONG INDIANS.</h3>

<p>This very general dissemination among the Indians of the American
continent of the sacred use of the powder of the tule, of images, idols,
or sacrificial cakes made of such prehistoric foods, certainly suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
that the Apache and the Aztecs, among whom they seem to have been
most freely used on ceremonial occasions, were invaders in the country
they respectively occupied, comparatively recent in their arrival among
the contiguous tribes like the Zu√±i and Tusayan who on corresponding
occasions offered to their gods a cultivated food like corn. The Tlascaltec
were known in Mexico as the "bread people," possibly because
they had been acquainted with the cultivation of the cereals long before
the Aztecs. Similarly, there was a differentiation of the Apache from
the sedentary Pueblos. The Apache were known to all the villages of
the Pueblos as a "corn-buying tribe," as will presently be shown. It
is true that in isolated cases and in widely separated sections the
Apache have for nearly two centuries been a corn-planting people, because
we find accounts in the Spanish chronicles of the discovery and
destruction by their military expeditions of "trojes" or magazines of
Apache corn near the San Francisco (or Verde) River, in the present
Territory of Arizona, as early as the middle of the last century. But
the general practice of the tribe was to purchase its bread or meal from
the Pueblos at such times as hostilities were not an obstacle to free
trade. There was this difference to be noted between the Apache and
the Aztecs: The latter had been long enough in the valley of Anahuac
to learn and adopt many new foods, as we learn from Duran, who relates
that at their festivals in honor of Tezcatlipoca, or those made in pursuance
of some vow, the women cooked an astonishing variety of bread,
just as, at the festivals of the Zu√±i, Tusayan, and other Pueblos in our
own time, thirty different kinds of preparations of corn may be
found.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
I was personally informed by old Indians in the pueblos along the Rio
Grande that they had been in the habit of trading with the Apache
and Comanche of the Staked Plains of Texas until within very recent
years; in fact, I remember seeing such a party of Pueblos on its return
from Texas in 1869, as it reached Fort Craig, New Mexico, where I was
then stationed. I bought a buffalo robe from them. The principal
article of sale on the side of the Pueblos was cornmeal. The Zu√±i also
carried on this mixed trade and hunting, as I was informed by the old
chief Pedro Pino and others. The Tusayan denied that they had ever
traded with the Apache so far to the east as the buffalo country, but
asserted that the Comanche had once sent a large body of their people
over to Walpi to trade with the Tusayan, among whom they remained
for two years. There was one buffalo robe among the Tusayan at their
snake dance in 1881, possibly obtained from the Ute to the north of
them.</p>

<p>The trade carried on by the "buffalo" Indians with the Pueblos was
noticed by Don Juan de O√±ate as early as 1599. He describes them as
"dressed in skins, which they also carried into the settled provinces to
sell, and brought back in return
cornmeal."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>
<p>Gregg<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
speaks of the "Comancheros" or Mexicans and Pueblos who
ventured out on the plains to trade with the Comanche, the principal
article of traffic being bread.
Whipple<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
refers to this trade as carried
on with all the nomadic tribes of the Llano Estacado, one of which we
know to have been the eastern division of the Apache. The principal
article bartered with the wild tribes was flour, i.e., cornmeal.</p>

<p>In another place he tells us of "Pueblo Indians from Santo Domingo,
with flour and bread to barter with the K√°i-√≤-w√†s and Comanches for
buffalo robes and horses."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
Again, Mexicans were seen with flour,
bread, and tobacco, "bound for Comanche land to trade. We had no
previous idea of the extent of this Indian
trade."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
Only one other
reference to this intertribal commerce will be introduced.</p>

<p>Vetancurt<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
mentions that the Franciscan friars, between 1630 and
1680, had erected a magnificent "temple" to "Our Lady of the Angels
of Porci√∫ncula," and that the walls were so thick that offices were
established in their concavities. On each side of this temple, which
was erected in the pueblo of Pecos (situated at or near the head of the
Pecos River, about 30 miles southeast of Santa F√©, New Mexico, on
the eastern rim of the Llano Estacado), were three towers. At the foot
of the hill was a plain about one league in circumference, to which the
Apache resorted for trade. These were the Apache living on the
plains of Texas. They brought with them buffalo robes, deer skins
and other things to exchange for corn. They came with their dog-trains
loaded, and there were more than five hundred traders arriving
each year.</p>

<p>Observe that here we have the first and only reference to the use of
dog trains by the Apache who in every other case make their women
carry all plunder in baskets on their backs. In this same extract from
Vetancurt there is a valuable remark about Quivira: "Este es el paso
para los reinos de la Quivira."</p>


<h3>ANALOGUES OF HODDENTIN.</h3>

<p>In the citation from the Spanish poet Villagr√°, already given, the suggestion
occurs that some relationship existed between the powder scattered
so freely during the Spanish "carnestolendas" and the "kunque"
thrown by the people of Tusayan upon the Spaniards and their horses
when the Spaniards first entered that country. This analogy is a very
striking one, even though the Spaniards have long since lost all idea
of the meaning of the practice which they still follow. It is to be
noted, however, that one of the occasions when this flour is most freely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
used is the Eve of All Saints (Hallowe'en), when the ghosts or ancestors
of the community were to be the recipients of every
attention.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>In the East, the use of the reddish or purple powder called the "gul√°l"
is widely prevalent, but it is used at the feast of Huli, which occurs
at the time of the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>There seems to have been used in Japan in very ancient days a powder
identical with the hoddentin, and, like it, credited with the power
to cure and rejuvenate.</p>

<p>In the mythical period, from the most ancient times to about B. C.
200, being the period of the so-called pure Japanese "medicine," it is
related that Ona-muchi-no-mikoko gave these directions to a hare which
had been flayed by a crocodile: "Go quickly now to the river mouth,
wash thy body with fresh water, then take the pollen of the sedges and
spread it about, and roll about upon it; whereupon thy body will certainly
be restored to its original
state."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>There is no indication that in the above case the "pollen of the sedges"
had ever occupied a place in the list of foods. It would appear that its
magical effects were strictly dependent upon the fact that it was recognized
as the reproductive agent in the life of the plant.</p>

<p>No allusion has yet been made to the hoddentin of the Navajo, who
are the brothers of the Apache. Surgeon
Matthews<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> has referred to
it under the name of tqa-di-tin&#5151;, or ta-di-tin&#5151;,
"the pollen, especially
the pollen of corn."</p>

<p>This appears to me to be a very interesting case of a compromise between
the religious ideas of two entirely different systems or sects. The
Navajo, as now known to us, are the offspring of the original Apache
or Tinneh invaders and the refugees from the Rio Grande and Zu√±i
Pueblos, who fled to the fierce and cruel Apache to seek safety from the
fiercer and more cruel Spanish.</p>

<p>The Apache, we have shown, offer up in sacrifice their traditional
food, the pollen of the tule. The Zu√±i, as we have also shown, offer up
their traditional food, the meal of corn, to which there have since been
added sea shells and other components with a symbolical significance.
The Navajo, the progeny of both, naturally seek to effect a combination
or compromise of the two systems and make use of the
pollen of the corn. Kohl narrates an Ojibwa legend to the effect that
their god Menaboju, returning from the warpath, painted his face with
"pleasant yellow stripes ... of the yellow foam that covers the
water in spring," and he adds that this is "probably the yellow pollen
that falls from the pine." He
quotes<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
another legend of the magic red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
powder for curing diseases once given by the snake spirit of the waters
to an Ojibwa.</p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
has this to say of the use of pollen by the ancients
which he recognizes as connected with the principle of fertility:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>&#913;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;</i>, the sweet smell, means also a
flower, that is Pushpa or Pushto. This was
the language of the followers of the Phasah or the Lamb&mdash;it was the language of
the Flower, of the Natzir, of the Flos-floris of Flora, of the Arouma, and of the
flour of Ceres, or the Eucharistia. It was the language of the pollen, the pollen of
plants, the principle of generation, of the Pole or Phallus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Buddha was a flower, because as flour or pollen he was the principle of fructification
or generation. He was flour because flour was the fine or valuable part of
the plant of Ceres, or wheat, the pollen which, I am told, in this plant, and in this
plant alone, renews itself when destroyed. When the flour, pollen, is killed, it grows
again several times. This is a very beautiful type or symbol of the resurrection.
On this account the flour of wheat was the sacrifice offered to the <i>&#935;&#961;&#951;&#962;</i> or Ceres in
the <i>&#917;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#945;</i>.
In this pollen we have the name of pall or pallium and of Pallas, in
the first language meaning <i>wisdom</i>.... When the devotee ate the bread he ate
the pollen, and thus ate the body of the God of generation; hence might come transubstantiation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lupton,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
 in 1660, describes a "powder of the flowers [pollen?] of elder,
gathered on a midsummer day," which was taken to restore lost youth.
Brand, it may be as well to say, traces back the custom of throwing
flour into the faces of women and others on the streets at Shrovetide,
in Minorca and elsewhere, to the time of the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>In writing the description of the Snake Dance of the Moquis of Arizona,
I ventured to advance the surmise that the corn flour with
which the sacred snakes were covered, and with which the air was
whitened, would be found upon investigation to be closely related to
the crithomancy or divination by grains of the cereals, as practiced
among the ancient Greeks. Crithomancy, strictly speaking, meant a
divination by grains of corn. The expression which I should have employed
was alphitomancy, a divination "by meal, flower, or
branne."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
But both methods of divination have been noticed among the aborigines
of America.</p>

<p>In Peru the medicine-men were divided into classes, as were those of
ancient Egypt. These medicine-men "made the various means of divination
specialities." Some of them predicted by "the shapes of grains
of maize taken at random."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
In Guatemala grains of corn or of chile
were used indiscriminately, and in Guazacualco the medicine-women
used grains of frijoles or black beans. In Guatemala they had what
they called "ahquij." "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Este modo de adivinar se llama ahquij, malol-tzit√®,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>

<p>In Guazacualco the medicine-women "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hechaban suertes con granos de
Frisoles, a manera de Dados, i hacian sus invocaciones, porque eran
Hechiceros: i si el Dado decia bien, proseguian en la cura, diciendo

<p>Herrera in the preceding paragraph recognizes the close similarity
between this sacred ceremony of casting lots or divining, and the more
orthodox method of gambling, pure and simple, which has in every case
been derived from a sacred origin.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Hachus</span> [one class of Peruvian priests] <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consultaient l'avenir au

<p>The Mexicans "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">para saber si los enfermos habian de morir, √≥ sanar
de la enfermedad que tenian, echaban un pu√±ado de maiz lo mas grueso

<p>Father Breb&oelig;uf relates that at the Huron feast of the dead, which
occurred every 8 or 10 years and which he saw at Ossossane, "a few
grains of Indian corn were thrown by the women upon the sacred
relics."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>


<h3>THE DOWN OF BIRDS IN CEREMONIAL OBSERVANCES.</h3>

<p>No exhaustive and accurate examination of the subject of hoddentin
could be made without bringing the investigator face to face with the
curious analogue of "down" throwing and sprinkling which seemingly
obtains with tribes which at some period of their history have been
compelled to rely upon birds as a main component of their diet. Examples
of this are to be met with on both sides of the Pacific as well
as in remote Australia, and were the matter more fully examined there
is no doubt that some other identifications might be made in very
unexpected quarters. The down used by the Tchuktchi on occasions
of ceremony had a suggestion of religion about
it.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> "On leaving the
shore, they sung and danced. One who stood at the head of the boat
was employed in plucking out the feathers of a bird's skin and blowing
them in the air."</p>

<p>In Langsdorff's Travels<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
we learn that some of the dancers of the
Koluschan of Sitka have their heads powdered with the small down
feathers of the white-headed eagle and ornamented with ermine; also,
that the hair and bodies of the Indians at the mission of Saint Joseph,
New California, were powdered with down
feathers.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>
<p>The Indians from the North Pacific coast seen visiting the mission
of San Francisco, by Kotzebue in 1816, "had their long disordered
hair covered with down."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft says of the Nootka of the northwest coast of British
America: "the hair is powdered plentifully with white feathers, which
are regarded as the crowning ornament for manly dignity in all these
regions."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The bird's down used by the Haida of British North America in
their dances seems very closely related to hoddentin. They not only
put it upon their own persons, but "delight to communicate it to their
partners in bowing," and also "blow it into the air at regular intervals
through a painted tube." They also scattered down as a sign of welcome
to the first European
navigators.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>In all these dances, ceremonial visits, and receptions of strangers the
religious element can be discerned more or less plainly. The Indians
west of the Mississippi with whom Father Hennepin was a prisoner in
1680, and who appear to have been a branch of the Sioux (Issati or
Santee and Nadouessan), had a grand dance to signalize the killing
of a bear. On this occasion, which was participated in by the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">principaux
chefs et guerriers</span>," we learn that there was this to be noted in
their dress: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ayant m√™me leurs cheveux frottez d'huile d'ours &amp; parsemez
de plumes, rouges &amp; blanches &amp; les t√™tes charg√©es de duvet
d'oiseaux.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>"Swan's and bustard's down" was used by the Accancess [i.e., the
Arkansas of the Siouan stock] in their religious
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Of the war dress of the members of the Five Nations we learn from
an early writer: "Their heads [previously denuded of all hair except
that of the crown] are painted red down to the eye-brows and sprinkled
over with white down."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The Indians of Virginia at their war dances painted themselves to
make them more terrible: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour se rendre plus terriblee, ils s√©ment
des plumes, du duvet, ou du poil de quelque b√™te sur la peinture toute
fraiche.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
Down was also used by the medicine-men of the
Carib.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
The down of birds was used in much the same way by the tribes of
Cuman√°, a district of South America not far from the mouth of the
Orinoco, in the present territory of
Venezuela;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
by the Tupinambis, of
Brazil, who covered the bodies of their victims with
it;<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
by the Chiribchi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
of South America,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
and by the tribes of the Isthmus of
Darien.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
This down has also been used by some of the Australians in their
sacred dances.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
"The hair, or rather the wool upon their heads, was
very abundantly powdered with white powder.... They powder
not only their heads, but their beards
too."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>In China "there is a widespread superstition that the feathers of birds,
after undergoing certain incantations, are thrown up into the air, and
being carried away by the wind work blight and destruction wherever
they alight."</p>

<p>The down of birds seems not to have been unknown in Europe. To
this day it is poured upon the heads of the bride and groom in weddings
among the Russian peasantry.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>This leads up to the inquiry whether or not the application of tar
and feathers to the person may not at an early period have been an
act of religious significance, perverted into a ridiculous and infamous
punishment by a conquering and unrelenting hostile sect. The subject
certainly seems to have awakened the curiosity of the learned
Buckle, whose remarks may as well be given.</p>

<p>Richard, during his stay in Normandy (1189), made some singular
laws for regulating the conduct of the pilgrims in their passage by
sea. "A robber, convicted of theft, shall be shaved in the manner
of a champion; and boiling pitch poured upon his head, and the
feathers of a pillow shaken over his head to distinguish him; and be
landed at the first port where the ships shall
stop."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>The circumstances mentioned in the text respecting tarring and
feathering is a fine subject for comment by the searchers into popular
antiquities.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>


<h3>HAIR POWDER.</h3>

<p>Speaking of the "duvet" or down, with which many American savage
tribes deck themselves, Picart observes very justly: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cet ornement est
bizare, mais dans le fond l'est il beaucoup plus que cette poudre d'or
dont les Anciens, se poudroient la t√™te, ou que cette poudre compos√©e
d'amidon avec laquelle nos petits maitres modernes affectent de blanchir
leurs cheveux ou leurs
perruques?</span>"<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Picart does not say, and perhaps it would not be wise for us to surmise,
that these modes of powdering had a religious origin.</p>

<p>The custom of powdering the hair seems to be a savage "survival;"
at least, it is still to be found among the Friendly Islanders, among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
whom it was observed by
Forster.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
These islanders used a white lime
powder, also one of blue and another of orange made of turmeric.</p>

<p>The Sandwich Islanders plastered their hair over "with a kind of
lime made from burnt shells,"<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
and Dillon speaks of the Friendly
Islanders using lime, as Forster has already informed
us.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The Hottentots
made a lavish use of the medicinal powder of the buchu, which
they plastered on their heads, threw to their sacred animals, and used
liberally at their funerals.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Kolben dispels all doubt by saying:
"These powderings are religious formalities." He also alludes to the
use, in much the same manner, of ashes by the same
people.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The use of ashes also occurs among the Zu√±i, the Apache (at times),
and the Abipone of Paraguay. Ashes are also "thrown in the way of
a whirlwind to appease
it."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>In the Witches' Sabbath, in Germany, "it was said that the witches
burned a he goat, and divided its ashes among
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>In all the above cases, as well as in that of the use of ashes in the
Christian churches, it is possible that the origin of the custom might
be traced back either to a desire to share in the burnt offering or else
in that of preserving some of the incinerated dust of the dead friend or
relative for whom the tribe or clan was in mourning. Ashes in the
Christian church were not confined to Lent alone; they "were worn
four times a year, as in the beginning of
Lent."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Tuphramancy or divination by ashes was one of the methods of forecast
in use among the priests of pagan
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In Northumberland the custom prevailed of making bonfires on the
hills on St. Peter's day. "They made encroachments, on these occasions,
upon the bonfires of the neighbouring towns, of which they took
away some of the ashes by force: This they called 'carrying off the
flower (probably the flour) of the
wake.'<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
Moresin thinks this a vestige
of the ancient Cerealia."</p>

<p>The mourning at Iddah, in Guinea, consists in smearing the forehead
"with wood ashes and clay water, which is allowed to dry on. They
likewise powder their hair with wood
ashes."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>
<h3>DUST FROM CHURCHES&mdash;ITS USE.</h3>

<p>The last ceremonial powder to be described is dust from the ground,
as among some of the Australians who smear their heads with pipe-clay
as a sign of mourning.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The French writers mention among the ceremonies of the Natchez
one in which the Great Sun "gathered dust, which he threw back over
his head, and turned successively to the four quarters of the world in
repeating the same act of throwing
dust."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>Mention is made of "an old woman who acted as beadle" of a church,
who "once brought to the bedside of a dying person some of the sweepings
from the floor of the altar, to ease and shorten a very lingering
death."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>Altar dust was a very ancient remedy for disease. Frommann says
that, of the four tablets found in a temple of Esculapius, one bore this
inscription: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lucio affecto lateris dolore; veniret et ex ara tollerit
cinerem et una cum vino comisceret et poneret supra latus; et convaluit</span>,"
etc.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>It seems then that the medi√¶val use of altar dust traces back to the
Roman use of altar ashes.</p>

<p>So hard is it to eradicate from the minds of savages ideas which have
become ingrafted upon their nature that we need not be surprised to
read in the Jesuit relations of affairs in Canada (1696-1702) that, at
the Mission of Saint Francis, where the Indians venerated the memory

<p>A few persons are to be found who endeavor to collect the dust from
the feet of one hundred thousand Brahmins. One way of collecting this
dust is by spreading a cloth before the door of a house where a great

comes out, he shakes the dust from his feet as he treads upon this cloth.

<h3>CLAY-EATING.</h3>

<p>The eating of clay would appear to have once prevailed all over the
world. In places the custom has degenerated into ceremonial or is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
be found only in myths. The Aztec devotee picked up a pinch of clay
in the temple of Tezcatlipoca and ate it with the greatest
reverence.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>Sahagun is quoted by
Squier<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
as saying that the Mexicans swore by
the sun and "by our sovereign mother, the Earth," and ate a piece of
earth.</p>

<p>But the use of clay by the Mexicans was not merely a matter of ceremony;
clay seems to have been an edible in quite common use.</p>

<p>Edible earth was sold openly in the markets of Mexico; "yaun tierra,"
says Gomara in the list of foods given by
him.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>The eating of clay was forbidden to Mexican women during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Diego Duran describes the ceremonial eating of clay in the temples
of Mexico; "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lleg√≥ el dedo al suelo, y cogiendo tierra en √©l lo meti√≥ en
la boca; √° la cual ceremonia llamaban comer tierra
santa.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> And again
he says that in their sacrifices the Mexican nobles ate earth from the
feet of the idols. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Comian tierra de la que estaba √° los pies del
Ydolo.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
But the Mexicans did not limit themselves to a ceremonial clay-eating
alone. Thomas Gage relates that "they ate a kind of earth, for at one
season in the yeer they had nets of mayle, with the which they raked up
a certaine dust that is bred upon the water of the Lake of Mexico, and
that is kneaded together like unto oas of the
sea."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>Diego Duran<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
mentions the ceremonial clay-eating at the feast of
Tezcatlipoca agreeing with the note already taken from Kingsborough.</p>

<p>There is reference to clay-eating in one of the myths given in the
Popol-Vuh. The Quiche deities Hunahpu and Xbalanqu√©, desiring to
overcome the god Cabrakan, fed him upon roasted birds, but they took
care to rub one of the birds with "tizate" and to put white powder
around it. The circle of white powder was, no doubt, a circle of hoddentin
or something analogous thereto, intended to prevent any baleful
influence being exercised by Cabrakan. "Mais ils frott√®rent l'un
des oiseaux avec du <i>tizate</i> et lui mirent de la poussi√®re blanche √†
l'entour."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>In a footnote the word "tizate" is explained to be a very friable
whitish earth, used in polishing metals, making cement, etc.: "Terre
blanch√¢tre fort friable, et dont ils se servent pour polir les m√©taux,
faire du ciment, etc."</p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca says that the Indians of Florida ate clay&mdash;"de la

<p>At the trial of Vasco Pocallo de Figueroa, in Santiago de Cuba, in
1522, "for cruelty to the natives," he sought to make it appear that the
Indians ate clay as a means of suicide: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">el abuso de los Indios en

Whether the word "dirt" as here employed means
filth, or earth and clay, is not plain; it probably means clay and earth.</p>

<p>Venegas asserts that the Indians of California ate earth. The traditions
of the Indians of San Juan Capistrano, California, and vicinity

<p>Sir John Franklin<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
relates that the banks of the Mackenzie River in
British North America contain layers of a kind of unctuous mud, probably
similar to that found near the Orinoco, which the Tinneh Indians
"use occasionally as food during seasons of famine, and even at other
times chew as an amusement.... It has a milky taste and the
flavour is not disagreeable."</p>

<p>Father de Smet<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
says of the Athapascan: "Many wandering families
of the Carrier tribe ... have their teeth worn to the gums by the
earth and sand they swallow with their nourishment." This does not
seem to have been intentionally eaten.</p>

<p>"Some of the Siberian tribes, when they travel, carry a small bag of

<p>There is nothing in the records relating to Victoria respecting the

Australia.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The Apache and Navajo branches of the Athapascan family are not
unacquainted with the use of clay as a comestible, although among the
former it is now scarcely ever used and among the latter used only as
a condiment to relieve the bitterness of the taste of the wild potato; in
the same manner it is known to both the Zu√±i and Tusayan.</p>

<h3>PREHISTORIC FOODS USED IN COVENANTS.</h3>

<p>It has been shown that the Apache, on several occasions, as when
going out to meet strangers, entering into solemn agreements, etc.,
made use of the hoddentin. A similar use of food, generally prehistoric,
can be noted in other regions of the world.</p>

<p>It was a kind of superstitious trial used among the Saxons to purge
themselves of any accusation by taking a piece of barley bread and eating
it with solemn oaths and execrations that it might prove poisonous
or their last morsel if what they asserted or denied was not
true.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
Those pieces of bread were first execrated by the priest, from which he
infers that at a still earlier day sacramental bread may have been used
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>At Rome, in the time of Cicero and Horace, a master who suspected
that his slaves had robbed him conducted them before a priest. They
were each obliged to eat a cake over which the priest had "pronounced
some magical words (<i>carmine
infectum</i>)."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<h3>SACRED BREADS AND CAKES.</h3>

<p>Since the employment of hoddentin, or tule pollen, as a sacred commemorative
food would seem to have been fairly demonstrated, before
closing this section I wish to add a few paragraphs upon the very general
existence of ritualistic farinaceous foods in all parts of the world.
They can be detected most frequently in the ceremonial reversion to a
grain or seed which has passed or is passing out of everyday use in
some particular form given to the cake or bread or some circumstance
of time, place, and mode of manufacture and consumption which stamps
it as a "survival." So deeply impressed was
Grimm<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
with the wide horizon
spreading around the consideration of this topic that he observed:
"Our knowledge of heathen antiquities will gain both by the study of
these drinking usages which have lasted into later times and also of
the shapes given to <i>baked meats</i>, which either retained the actual forms
of ancient idols or were accompanied by sacrificial observances. A
history of German cakes and bread rolls might contain some unexpected
disclosures.... Even the shape of cakes is a reminiscence of the
sacrifices of heathenism."</p>

<p>The first bread or cake to be mentioned in this part of the subject is
the pancake, still so frequently used on the evening of Shrove Tuesday.
In antiquity it can be traced back before the Reformation, before the
Crusades were dreamed of, before the Barbarians had subverted Rome,
before Rome itself had fairly taken shape.</p>

<p>There seems to have been a very decided religious significance in the
preparation of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. In Leicestershire, "On
Shrove Tuesday a bell rings at noon, which is meant as a signal for the
people to begin frying their
pancakes."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>"The Norman <i>Crispell√¶</i> (Du Cange) are evidently taken from the
<i>Fornacalia</i>, on the 18th of February, in memory of the method of making
bread, before the Goddess <i>Fornax</i> invented
ovens."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>Under "Crispell√¶," Du Cange says: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rustici apud Normannos vocant
Crespes, ova pauca mixta cum farina, et in sartagine frixa</span>," and says
that they are "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex herba, farina et
oleo</span>."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
These same Crispell√¶ are to
be seen on the Rio Grande during Christmas week.</p>

<p>In the Greek Church and throughout Russia there is to the present
time a "pancake feast" at
Shrovetide.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>
<p>At one time a custom prevailed of going about from one friend's
house to another, masked, and committing every conceivable prank.
"Then the people feasted on blinnies&mdash;a pancake similar to the English
crumpet."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>In the pancake we have most probably the earliest form of farinaceous
food known to the nations which derived their civilization from
the basin of the Mediterranean. Among these nations wheat has been
in use from a time far beyond the remotest historical period, and to account
for its introduction myth has been invoked; but this wheat was
cooked without leaven, or was fried in a pan, after the style of the tortilla
still used in Spanish-speaking countries, or of the pancake common
among ourselves. Pliny<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
says that there were no bakers known in
Rome until nearly six hundred years after the foundation of the city,
in the days of the war with Persia; but he perhaps meant the public
bakers authorized by law. The use of wheat and the art of baking
bread, as we understand it to-day, were practically unknown to the nations
of northern Europe until within the recent historical
period.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>
<p>Nothing would be more in consonance with the mode of reasoning of
a primitive people than that, at certain designated festivals, there should
be a recurrence to the earlier forms of food, a reversion to an earlier
mode of life, as a sort of propitiation of the gods or goddesses who
had cared for the nation in its infancy and to secure the continuance of
their beneficent offices. Primitive man was never so certain of the
power of the gods of the era of his own greatest development that he
could rely upon it implicitly and exclusively and ignore the deities who
had helped him to stand upon his feet. Hence, the recurrence to pancakes,
to unleavened breads of all kinds, among various peoples. This
view of the subject was made plain to me while among the Zu√±i Indians.
Mr. Frank H. Cushing showed me that the women, when baking
the "loaves" of bread, were always careful to place in the adobe
ovens a tortilla with each batch of the newer kind, and no doubt for
the reason just given.</p>


<h3>UNLEAVENED BREAD.</h3>

<p>The unleavened bread of the earliest period of Jewish history has
come down to our own times in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, still
observed by the Hebrews in all parts of the world, in the bread used in
the eucharistic sacrifice by so large a portion of the Christian world,
and apparently in some of the usages connected with the half-understood
fast known as the "Ember Days." Brand quotes from an old
work in regard to the Ember Days: "They were so called 'because
that our elder fathers wolde on these days ete no brede but cakes made
under ashes.'"<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>The sacred cake or "draona" of the Parsi "is a small round pancake
or wafer of unleavened bread, about the size of the palm of the hand.
It is made of wheaten flour and water, with a little clarified butter, and
is flexible."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
A variety of the "draona," called a "frasast," is marked
with the finger nail and set aside for the guardian spirits of the
departed.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Cakes and salt were used in religious rites by the ancients. The
Jews probably adopted their appropriation from the
Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> "During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
all the Passover week&mdash;14th to 21st Nisan, i.e., during this week's
moon&mdash;Shemites fast, only eating unleavened bread, and most diligently&mdash;not
without reason&mdash;cleansing their houses." "And especially
had all leavened matter to be removed, for the new leavener had now
arisen, and prayers with curses were offered up against any portions
which might have escaped observation. The law of their fierce Jahveh
was that, whoever during all this festival tasted leavened bread, 'that
soul should be cut off,' which Godwyn mollifies by urging that this only
meant the offender should die without children; which was still a
pretty considerable punishment for eating a piece of
bread!"<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>"The great day of Pentecost is the 6th of Sivan, or, say, the 22d
of May, 1874. From the first barley <i>two loaves</i> were then made, 'the
offering of which was the distinguishing rite of the day of
Pentecost.'"<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>On St. Bridget's Eve every farmer's wife in Ireland makes a cake,
called <i>bairinbreac</i>; the neighbors are invited, the madder of ale and
the pipe go round, and the evening concludes with mirth and
festivity.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
Vallencey identifies this as the same kind of offering that was made to
Ceres, and to "the queen of heaven, to whom the Jewish women burnt
incense, poured out drink offerings, and made cakes for her with their
own hands."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>


<h3>THE HOT CROSS BUNS OF GOOD FRIDAY.</h3>

<p>The belief prevailed that these would not mold like ordinary
bread.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>"In several counties [in England] a small loaf of bread is annually
baked on the morning of Good Friday and then put by till the same
anniversary in the ensuing year. This bread is not intended to be
eaten, but to be used as a medicine, and the mode of administering it is
by grating a small portion of it into water and forming a sort of panada.
It is believed to be good for many disorders, but particularly for a diarrh&oelig;a,
for which it is considered a sovereign remedy. Some years ago
a cottager lamented that her poor neighbour must certainly die of this
complaint, because she had already given her two doses of Good Friday
bread without any benefit. No information could be obtained from the
doctress respecting her nostrum, but that she had heard old folks say
that it was a good thing and that she always made
it."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>Brand quotes a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine who shows that
they were "formerly, at least, unleavened," p. 156. They "are constantly
marked with the form of the cross." "It is an old belief that
the observance of the custom of eating buns on Good Friday protects
the house from fire, and several other virtues are attributed to these
buns," p. 156. "Hutchinson, in his History of Northumberland, following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
Bryant's Analysis, derives the Good Friday bun from the sacred
cakes which were offered at the Arkite Temples, styled Boun, and presented
every seventh day," p. 155. A very interesting dissertation
upon these sacred cakes as used by the Greeks, Egyptians, and Jews
in the time of their idolatry, is to be found in Brand's work,
pp. 155-156.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Practices analogous to those referred to are to be noted among the
Pueblo Indians. They offer not only the kunque, but bread also in their
sacrifices.</p>

<p>In the sacred rabbit hunt of the Zu√±i, which occurs four times a year
and is carried on for the purpose of procuring meat for the sacred eagles
confined in cages, a great fire was made on the crest of a hill, into
which were thrown piles of bread crusts and in the smoke of which the
boomerangs or rabbit sticks were held while the hunter recited in an
audible tone and with downcast head the prayers prescribed for the
occasion. One of the early Spanish writers informs us that the women
of the pueblo of Santo Domingo, on the Rio Grande, offered bread on
bended knees to their idols and then preserved it for the remainder of
the year, and the house which did not have a supply of such blessed
bread was regarded as unfortunate and exposed to
danger.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>A prehistoric farinaceous food of the Romans survives in our bridecake
or wedding cake. It is well understood that among the Romans
there were three kinds of marriage: that called "coemptio," that called
"concubitu" or "usu," and the highest form of all, known as "confarratio,"
from the fact that bride and groom ate together of a kind of
cake or bread made of the prehistoric flour, the "far." We have preserved
the custom of having bridecake, which is still served with many
superstitious ceremonies: "it must be cut by the bride herself; it must
be broken in pieces (formerly these pieces were cast over the heads of
the bridesmaids), and, after being passed through a wedding ring a certain
number of times, it must be placed under the pillow of the anxious
maiden to serve as a basis for her
dreams."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Exactly what this prehistoric food was it is now an impossibility to
determine with exactness. Torquemada shows that long after the Romans
had obtained the use of wheat they persisted in the sacrificial use
of the "nola isla," "farro," and "escanda," forms of wild grain once
roasted and ground and made into bread by their
forefathers.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
A similar
usage prevailed among the Greeks. Pliny speaks of "the bearded
red wheat, named in Latin 'far,'" and tells us that rye was called
"secale" or "farrago."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
The radical "far" is still to be found all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
Europe in the word for flour, "farina," "farine," or "harina," while it is
also possible that it may be detected in the ever-to-be-honored name of
Farragut.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>In the eight marriage rites described by Baudh√¢yana, the initiatory
oblation in the fourth (that in which the father gives his daughter
away) consists of "parched grain." This rite is one of the four which
are lawful for a Brahman. The parched grain to be used would seem
to be either sesamum or barley, although this is not clear. Vasish<i>th</i>a
says, chapter 27, concerning secret penances: "He who ... uses
barley (for his food) becomes
pure."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>The pages of Brand<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
are filled with references to various forms of
cake which seem properly to be included under this chapter. In England
there formerly prevailed the custom of preparing "soul cakes" for
distribution among visitors to the family on that day and to bands
of waifs or singers, who expected them as a dole for praying and singing
in the interests of the souls of the dead friends and relatives of the
family. On the island of St. Kilda the soul cake was "a large cake in
the form of a triangle, furrowed round, and which was to be all eaten
that night."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
In Lancashire and Hertfordshire the cake was made of
oatmeal, but in many other parts it was a "seed
cake"<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
and in Warwickshire,
"at the end of barley and bean seed time, there is a custom
there to give the plowmen <i>froise</i>, a species of thick
pancake."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> "All-soul
cakes" were distributed at time of All Souls' Day.</p>

<p>In England and Scotland the old
custom<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
was to have a funeral feast,
which all friends and relations were expected to attend. Wine, currant
cake, meat, and other refreshments, varying according to the fortune
of the family, were served liberally. The bread given out was
called "arvil-bread." There is no special reason for believing that
this could be called a hoddentin custom, except that the writer himself
calls attention to the fact that in the earlier times the bread was in the
form of "wafers."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>The Romans had a college of priests called the "Fratres Arvales,"
nine, or, as some say, twelve in number, to whose care were committed
the sacrifices in honor of Ceres at the old limits of the city, to propitiate
that goddess and induce her to bestow fertility upon the fields. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
ceremonies, which are believed by the editor of Bohn's Strabo to survive
in the Rogation Day processions of the Roman Catholic Church,
recall the notes already taken upon the subject of the Arval bread of
the Scotch.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
The sacrifices themselves were designated "Ambarva"
and "Ambarvalia."</p>

<p>In Scotland and England it was customary for bands of singers to go
from door to door on New Year's Eve, singing and receiving reward.
In the latter country "cheese and oaten cakes, which are called <i>farls</i>,
are distributed on this occasion among the cryers." In the former
country "there was a custom of distributing sweet cakes and a particular
kind of sugared bread."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>A fine kind of wheat bread called "wassail-bread" formed an important
feature of the entertainment on New Year's Day in old
England.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Among love divinations may be reckoned the dumb cake, so called
because it was to be made without speaking, and afterwards the parties
were to go backward up the stairs to bed and put the cake under
their pillows, when they were to dream of their
lovers.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>References to the beal-tine ceremonies of Ireland and Scotland, in
which oatmeal gruel figured as a dish, or cakes made of oatmeal and
carraway seeds, may be found in Brand, Pop. Antiq., vol. 1, p. 226; in
Blount, Tenures of Land and Customs of Manors, London, 1874, p. 131;

a cake or loaf with holy water.</p>

<p>The mince pie and plum pudding of Christmas are evidently ancient
preparations, and it is not unlikely that the shape of the former, which,
prior to the Reformation, was that of a child's cradle, had a reminiscence
of the sacrifice of babies at the time of the winter solstice. Grimm has
taught that where human sacrifice had been abolished the figure of a
coffin or a cradle was still used as a symbol.</p>

<p>There is a wide field of information to be gleaned in the investigation

wish to add to the bulk of the present

<h3>GALENA.</h3>

<p>At times one may find in the "medicine" of the more prominent and
influential of the chiefs and medicine-men of the Apache little sacks
which, when opened, are found to contain pounded galena; this they
tell me is a "great medicine," fully equal to hoddentin, but more difficult
to obtain. It is used precisely as hoddentin is used; that is, both
as a face paint and as a powder to be thrown to the sun or other elements
to be propitiated. The Apache are reluctant to part with it,
and from living Apache I have never obtained more than one small
sack of it.</p>

<p>No one seems to understand the reason for its employment. Mr.
William M. Beebe has suggested that perhaps the fact that galena
always crystallizes in cubes, and that it would thus seem to have a
mysterious connection with the cardinal points to which all nomadic
peoples pay great attention as being invested with the power of keeping
wanderers from going astray, would not be without influence upon
the minds of the medicine-men, who are quick to detect and to profit by
all false analogies. The conjecture appears to me to be a most plausible
one, but I can submit it only as a conjecture, for no explanation of the
kind was received from any of the Indians. All that I can say is that
whenever procurable it was always used by the Apache on occasions
of unusual importance and solemnity and presented as a round disk
painted in the center of the forehead.</p>

<p>The significance of all these markings of the face among savage and
half-civilized nations is a subject deserving of the most careful research;
like the sectarial marks of the Hindus, all, or nearly all, the marks
made upon the faces of American Indians have a meaning beyond the
ornamental or the grotesque.</p>

<p>Galena was observed in use among the tribes seen by Cabeza de Vaca.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils nous donn√®rent beaucoup de bourses, contenant des sachets de marcassites
et d'antimoine en poudre.</span>" ("<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Taleguillas de margaxita y de
alcohol molido.</span>")<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
This word "margaxita" means iron pyrites. The
Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says that the Peruvians used it for "amulets;"
so also did the Apache. What Vaca took for antimony was pounded
galena no doubt. He was by this time in or near the Rocky
Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>On the northwest coast of America we read of the natives: "One,
however, as he came near, took out from his bosom some iron or lead-colored
micaceous earth and drew marks with it across his cheeks in
the shape of two pears, stuffed his nostrils with grass, and thrust thin
pieces of bone through the cartilage of his
nose."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>It is more than probable that some of the face-painting with "black
earth," "ground charcoal," etc., to which reference is made by the early
writers, may have been galena, which substance makes a deep-black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
mark. The natives would be likely to make use of their most sacred
powder upon first meeting with mysterious strangers like Vaca and his
companions. So, when the expedition of La Salle reached the mouth of
the Ohio, in 1680, the Indians are described as fasting and making
superstitious sacrifices; among other things, they marked themselves
with "black earth" and with "ground charcoal." "Se daban con
Tierra Negra o Carbon
molido."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>From an expression in Burton, I am led to suspect that the application
of kohl or antimony to the eyes of Arabian beauty is not altogether
for ornament. "There are many kinds of kohl used in medicine
and magic."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>Corbusier says of the Apache-Yuma: "Galena and burnt mescal are
used on their faces, the former to denote anger or as war paint, being
spread all over the face, except the chin and nose, which are painted
red."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>In Coleman's Mythology of the Hindus, London, 1832, page 165, may
be found a brief chapter upon the subject of the sectarial marks of the
Hindus. With these we may fairly compare the marks which the
Apache, on ceremonial occasions, make upon cheeks and forehead.
The adherents of the Brahminical sects, before entering a temple, must
mark themselves upon the forehead with the tiluk. Among the Vishnuites,
this is a longitudinal vermilion line. The Seevites use several
parallel lines in saffron.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
Maurice adds that the Hindus place the tiluk
upon their idols in twelve places.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
"Among the Kaffir the warriors
are rendered invulnerable by means of a black cross on their foreheads
and black stripes on the cheeks, both painted by the Inyanga, or
fetich priest."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>A piece of galena weighing 7&#189; pounds was found in a mound near
Naples, Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
Occasionally with the bones of the dead are noticed
small cubes of galena; and in our collection is a ball of this ore, weighing
a pound and two ounces, which was taken from a mound, and which
probably did service, enveloped in raw hide, as some form of
weapon.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
Galena was much prized by the former inhabitants of North America.
"The frequent occurrence of galena on the altars of the sacrificial
mounds proves, at any rate, that the ancient inhabitants attributed a
peculiar value to it, deeming it worthy to be offered as a sacrificial
gift."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE IZZE-KLOTH OR MEDICINE CORD OF THE APACHE.</small></h2>


<p>There is probably no more mysterious or interesting portion of the
religious or "medicinal" equipment of the Apache Indian, whether he
be medicine-man or simply a member of the laity, than the "izze-kloth"
or medicine cord, illustrations of which accompany this text.
Less, perhaps, is known concerning it than any other article upon
which he relies in his distress.</p>

<p>I regret very much to say that I am unable to afford the slightest
clew to the meaning of any of the parts or appendages of the cords
which I have seen or which I have procured. Some excuse for this is to
be found in the fact that the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred
that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or
talk about them. I made particular effort to cultivate the most
friendly and, when possible, intimate relations with such of the Apache
and other medicine-men as seemed to offer the best chance for obtaining
information in regard to this and other matters, but I am compelled
to say with no success at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Fig.
435.&mdash;Single-strand medicine cord (Zu√±i).</span>
</div>

<p>I did advance so far in my schemes that Na-a-cha, a prominent medicine-man
of the Tonto Apache, promised to let me have his cord, but as
an eruption of hostility on the part of the tribe called me away from the
San Carlos Agency, the opportunity was lost. Ramon, one of the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
medicine-men of the Chiricahua Apache, made me the same
promise concerning the cord which he wore and which figures in these
plates. It was, unfortunately, sent me by mail, and, although the best
in the series and really one of the best I have ever been fortunate
enough to see on either living or dead, it was not accompanied by a
description of the symbolism of the different articles attached. Ramon
also gave me the head-dress which he wore in the spirit or ghost
dance, and explained everything thereon, and I am satisfied that he
would also, while in the same frame of mind, have given me all the information
in his power in regard to the sacred or medicine cord as well,
had I been near him.</p>

<p>There are some things belonging to these cords which I understand
from having had them explained at other times, but there are others
about which I am in extreme doubt and ignorance. There are four
specimens of medicine cords represented and it is worth while to
observe that they were used as one, two, three, and four strand cords,
but whether this fact means that they belonged to medicine-men or to
warriors of different degrees I did
not learn nor do I venture to conjecture.</p>

<p>The single-strand medicine
cord with the thirteen olivella
shells belonged to a Zu√±i chief,
one of the priests of the sacred
order of the bow, upon whose
wrist it was worn as a sign of his
exalted rank in the tribe. I obtained
it as a proof of his sincerest
friendship and with injunctions
to say nothing about it to
his own people, but no explanation
was made at the moment of
the signification of the wristlet or
cord itself or of the reason for
using the olivella shells of that
particular number or for placing
them as they were placed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 241px;">

<span class="caption">Fig.
436.&mdash;Four-strand medicine cord (Apache).</span>
</div>

<p>One of the four-strand cords
was obtained from Ramon and is
the most beautiful and the most
valuable of the lot. Ramon
called my attention to the important
fact that it was composed
of four strands and that originally each had been stained a different
color. These colors were probably yellow, blue, white, and black,
although the only ones still discernible at this time are the yellow and
the blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>The three-strand cord was sent to me at Washington by my old
friend, Al. Seiber, a scout who has been living among the Apache for
twenty-five years. No explanation accompanied it and it was probably
procured from the body of some dead warrior during one of the innumerable
scouts and skirmishes which Seiber has had with this warlike
race during his long term of service against them. The two strand
cord was obtained by myself so long ago that the circumstances connected
with it have escaped my memory. These cords, in their perfection,
are decorated with beads and shells strung along at intervals,
with pieces of the sacred green chalchihuitl, which has had such a
mysterious ascendancy over the
minds of the American Indians&mdash;Aztec,
Peruvian, Quiche, as well
as the more savage tribes, like the
Apache and Navajo; with petrified
wood, rock crystal, eagle down,
claws of the hawk or eaglet, claws
of the bear, rattle of the rattlesnake,
buckskin bags of hoddentin,
circles of buckskin in which
are inclosed pieces of twigs and
branches of trees which have been
struck by lightning, small fragments
of the abalone shell from
the Pacific coast, and much other
sacred paraphernalia of a similar
kind.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/f437.jpg" width="211" height="400" alt="Fig.
437.&mdash;Three-strand medicine cord (Apache)." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig.
437.&mdash;Three-strand medicine cord (Apache).</span>
</div>

<p>That the use of these cords was
reserved for the most sacred and
important occasions, I soon
learned; they were not to be seen
on occasions of no moment, but
the dances for war, medicine, and
summoning the spirits at once
brought them out, and every medicine-man
of any consequence would
appear with one hanging from his
right shoulder over his left hip.</p>

<p>Only the chief medicine-men can make them, and after being made
and before being assumed by the new owner they must be sprinkled,
Ramon told me, with "heap hoddentin," a term meaning that there is
a great deal of attendant ceremony of a religious character.</p>

<p>These cords will protect a man while on the warpath, and many of
the Apache believe firmly that a bullet will have no effect upon the
warrior wearing one of them. This is not their only virtue by any
means; the wearer can tell who has stolen ponies or other property
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
from him or from his friends, can help the crops, and cure the sick. If
the circle attached to one of these cords (see Fig. 436) is placed
upon the head it will at once relieve any ache, while the cross attached
to another (see Fig. 439) prevents the wearer from going astray, no
matter where he may be; in other words, it has some connection with
cross-trails and the four cardinal points to which the Apache pay the
strictest attention. The Apache assured me that these cords were not
mnemonic and that the beads, feathers, knots, etc., attached to them
were not for the purpose of recalling to mind some duty to be performed
or prayer to be recited.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/f438.jpg" width="488" height="500" alt="Fig.
438.&mdash;Two-strand medicine cord (Apache)." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig.
438.&mdash;Two-strand medicine cord (Apache).</span>
</div>

<p>I was at first inclined to associate these cords with the quipus of the
Peruvians, and also with the wampum of the aborigines of the Atlantic
coast, and investigation only confirms this first suspicion. It is true
that both the wampum and the quipu seem to have advanced from
their primitive position as "medicine" and attained, ethnologically
speaking, the higher plane of a medium for facilitating exchange or disseminating
information, and for that reason their incorporation in this
chapter might be objected to by the hypercritical; but a careful perusal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
of all the notes upon the subject can not fail to convince the reader that
the use of just such medicine cords prevailed all over the world, under
one form or another, and has survived to our own times.</p>

<p>First, let me say a word about rosaries, the invention of which has
been attributed to St. Dominick, in Spain, and to St. Bridget, in Ireland.
Neither of these saints had anything to do with the invention or introduction
of the rosary, although each in his or her own province may
have adapted to new and better uses a cord already in general service
among all the peoples of Europe. The rosary, as such, was in general
use in parts of the world long before the time of Christ. Again, the
cords of the various religious orders were looked upon as medicine
cords and employed in that manner by the ignorant peasantry.</p>

<p>In this chapter I will insert notes showing the use of such cords by
other tribes, and follow with descriptions of the uses to which the cords
of St. Francis and others were put, and with references to the rosaries
of different races or different creeds; finally, I will remark upon the
superstitions connected with cords, belts, and strings, knotted or unknotted,
made of serpent skin, human skin, or human hair. The strangest
thing about it all is that observers have, with scarcely an exception,
contented themselves with noting the existence of such cords without
making the slightest effort to determine why they were used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>There are certain cords with medicine bags attached to be seen in the
figures of medicine-men in the drawings of the sacred altars given by
Matthews in his account of the Navajo medicine-men.</p>

<p>Cushing also has noted the existence of such cords in Zu√±i, and there
is no doubt that some at least of the so-called "fishing lines" found in
the Rio Verde cliff dwellings in Arizona were used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>Describing the tribes met on the Rio Colorado, in 1540-1541, Alarcon
says: "Likewise on the brawne of their armes they weare a streit string,
which they wind so often about that it becommeth as broad as one's
hand."<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
It must be remembered that the Indians thought that Alarcon
was a god, that they offered sacrifice to him, and that they wore all
the "medicine" they possessed.</p>

<p>In 1680, the Pueblos, under the leadership of Pop√©, of the pueblo of San
Juan, were successful in their attempt to throw off the Spanish yoke.
He made them believe that he was in league with the spirits, and "that
they directed him to make a rope of the palm leaf and tie in it a number
of knots to represent the number of days before the rebellion was to
take place; that he must send this rope to all the Pueblos in the kingdom,
when each should signify its approval of, and union with, the conspiracy
by untying one of the
knots."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>I suspect that this may have been an izze-kloth. We know nothing
about this rebellion excepting what has been derived through Spanish
sources; the conquerors despised the natives, and, with a very few
notable exceptions among the Franciscans, made no effort to study
their peculiarities. The discontent of the natives was aggravated by
this fact; they saw their idols pulled down, their ceremonial chambers
closed, their dances prohibited, and numbers of their people tried and
executed for witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
Fray Geronimo de Zarate Salmeron was a
striking example of the good to be effected by missionaries who are not
above studying their people; he acquired a complete mastery of the
language of the pueblo of Jemez, "and preached to the inhabitants in
their native tongue." He is represented as exercising great influence
over the people of Jemez, Sia, Santa Ana, and Acoma. In this rebellion
of 1680 the Pueblos expected to be joined by the
Apache.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>The izze-kloth of the Apache seems to have had its prototype in the
sacred string of beans with which Tecumseh's brother, the Shawnee
prophet, traveled among the Indian tribes, inciting them to war. Every
young warrior who agreed to go upon the warpath touched this "sacred
string of beans" in token of his solemn
pledge.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>Tanner says in the narrative of his captivity among the Ojibwa: "He
[the medicine-man] then gave me a small hoop of wood to wear on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
head like a cap. On one-half of this hoop was marked the figure of a
snake, whose office, as the chief told me, was to take care of the
water."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
The "small hoop of wood" of which Tanner speaks, to be worn on the
head, seems to be analogous to the small hoop attached to the izze-kloth,
to be worn or applied in cases of headache (Fig. 436). Reference to
something very much like the izze-kloth is made by Harmon as in use
among the Carriers of British North America. He says: "The lads, as
soon as they come to the age of puberty, tie cords, wound with swan's-down,
around each leg a little below the knee, which they wear during
one year, and then they are considered as
men."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Catlin speaks of
"mystery-beads" in use among the
Mandan.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
"The negro suspends
all about his person cords with most complicated
knots."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The female inhabitants of Alaska, Unalaska, and the Fox Islands
were represented by the Russian explorers of 1768 (Captain Krenitzin)
to "wear chequered strings around the arms and
legs."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> These cords
bear a striking resemblance to the "wresting cords" of the peasantry
of Europe. Some of the Australians preserve the hair of a dead man.
"It is spun into a cord and fastened around the head of a
warrior."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
"A cord of opossum hair around the neck, the ends drooping down on
the back and fastened to the belt," is one of the parts of the costume
assumed by those attaining manhood in the initiation ceremonies of the
Australians.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
Again, on pages 72 and 74, he calls it "the belt of manhood."
"The use of amulets was common among the Greeks and
Romans, whose amulets were principally formed of gems, crowns of
pearls, necklaces of coral, shells,
etc."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>When I first saw the medicine cords of the Apache, it occurred to
me that perhaps in some way they might be an inheritance from the
Franciscans, who, two centuries ago, had endeavored to plant missions
among the Apache, and did succeed in doing something for the
Navajo part of the tribe. I therefore examined the most convenient
authorities and learned that the cord of S. Fran√ßois, like the cord of St.
Augustine and the cord of St. Monica, was itself a medicine cord, representing
a descent from a condition of thought perfectly parallel to
that which has given birth to the izze-kloth. Thus Picart tells us:
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On appelle Cordon de S. Fran√ßois la grosse corde qui sert de ceinture
aux Religieux qui vivent sous la Regle de ce Saint.... Cette corde
ceint le corps du Moine, &amp; pend √† peu pr√©s jusqu'aux pieds. Elle lui sert
de discipline, &amp; pour cet effet, elle est arm√©e de distance en distance de
fort gros n&oelig;uds.... La Corde de S. Fran√ßois a souvent gueri les
malades, facilit√© les accouchemens, fortifi√© la sant√©, procur√© lign√©e &amp; fait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
une infinit√© d'autres miracles
√©difians.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
This author says of the girdle
of St. Augustine "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est de cuir</span>," and adds that the Augustinians
have a book which treats of the origin of their order, in which
occur these words: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est probable que nos premiers Peres, qui vivoient
sous la Loi de nature, √©tant habill√©s de peau devoient porter une
Ceinture de m√™me √©toffe.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
This last assumption is perfectly plausible.
For my part it has always seemed to me that monasticism is of very
ancient origin, antedating Christianity and representing the most conservative
element in the religious part of human nature. It clings
obstinately to primitive ideas with which would naturally be associated
primitive costume. The girdle of St. Monica had five knots. "The
monks [of the Levant] use a girdle with twelve knots, to shew that they
are followers of the twelve
apostles."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
Among the "sovereign remedies
for the headache" is mentioned "the belt of St.
Guthlac."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Buckle
refers to the fact that English women in labor wore "blessed girdles."
He thinks that they may have been Thomas Aquinas's
girdles.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Some older charms are to be found in Bale's Interlude concerning the
Laws of Nature, Moses, and Christ, 4to, 1562. Idolatry says:</p>

<p>The "girdle of St. Bridget," mentioned by
Mooney<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
and by other
writers, through which the sick were passed by their friends, was
simply a "survival" of the "Cunni Diaboli" still to be found in the
East Indies. This "girdle of St. Bridget" was made of straw and in
the form of a collar.</p>

<p>The custom prevailing in Catholic countries of being buried in the
habits of the monastic orders, of which we know that the cord was a
prominent feature, especially in those of St. Francis or St. Dominick,
is alluded to by
Brand.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
This custom seems to have been founded
upon a prior superstitious use of magical cords which were, till a comparatively
recent period, buried with the dead. The Roman Catholic
church anathematized those "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui s'imaginent faire plaisir aux morts ou
leur mettant entre les mains, ou en jettant sur leurs fosses, ou dans
leurs tombeaux de petites cordes nou√©es de plusieurs n&oelig;uds, &amp; d'autres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
semblables, ce qui est expressement condamn√© par le Synode de Ferrare
en 1612.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Evidently the desire was to be buried with cords or amulets
which in life they dared not wear.</p>

<p>We may infer that cords and other articles of monastic raiment can
be traced back to a most remote ancestry by reading the views of Godfrey
Higgins, in Anacalypsis, to the effect that there was a tradition
maintained among the Carmelites that their order had been established
by the prophet Elisha and that Jesus Christ himself had been one of
its members. Massingberd, speaking of the first arrival of the Carmelites
in England (about A. D. 1215), says: "They professed to be
newly arrived in Italy, driven out by the Saracens from the Holy Land,
where they had remained on Mount Carmel from the time of Elisha
the prophet. They assert that 'the sons of the prophets' had continued
on Mount Carmel as a poor brotherhood till the time of Christ,
soon after which they were miraculously converted, and that the Virgin
Mary joined their order and gave them a precious vestment called a
scapular."<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>


<h3>ANALOGUES TO BE FOUND AMONG THE AZTECS, PERUVIANS, AND
OTHERS.</h3>

<p>According to the different authorities cited below, it will be seen that
the Aztec priests were in the habit of consulting Fate by casting upon
the ground a handful of cords tied together; if the cords remained
bunched together, the sign was that the patient was to die, but if they
stretched out, then it was apparent that the patient was soon to stretch
out his legs and recover. Mendieta says: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tenian unos cordeles, hecho
de ellos un manojo como llavero donde las mujeres traen colgadas las
llaves, lanz√°banlos en el suelo, y si quedaban revueltos, decian que era
se√±al de muerte. Y si alguno √≥ algunos salian extendidos, ten√≠anlo por
se√±al de vida, diciendo: que ya comenzaba el enfermo √° extender los pi√©s

Diego Duran speaks of the Mexican priests casting lots
with knotted cords, "con nudillos de hilo echaban
suertes."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> When
the army of Cortes advanced into the interior of Mexico, his soldiers
found a forest of pine in which the trees were interlaced with certain
cords and papers which the wizards had placed there, telling the Tlascaltecs
that they would restrain the advance of the strangers and
deprive them of all strength:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hallaron un Pinar mui espeso, lleno de hilos i papeles, que enredaban los Arboles,
i atravesaban el camino, de que mucho se rieron los Castellanos; i dixeron graciosos
donaires, quando luego supieron que los Hechiceros havian dado √† entender √† los
Tlascaltecas que con aquellos hilos, i papeles havian de tener √† los Castellanos, i quitarles

<p>In the religious ceremonies of the Peruvians vague mention is made of
"a very long cable," "woven in four colours, black, white, red, and
yellow."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
The Inca wore a "llautu." "This was a red fringe in the fashion
of a border, which he wore across his forehead from one temple to the
other. The prince, who was heir apparent, wore a yellow fringe, which
was smaller than that of his
father."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
In another place, Garcilaso says:
"It was of many colours, about a finger in width and a little less in
thickness. They twisted this fringe three or four times around the
head and let it hang after the manner of a
garland."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>

The accompanying citation from Montfaucon
would seem to show that among the Romans were to be found sacred
baldrics in use by the war priests; such baldrics are to be seen also
among the American aborigines, and correspond very closely to the
medicine cords. Montfaucon describes the Saliens, who among the
Romans were the priests of Mars, the god of war; these priests in
the month of March had a festival which was probably nothing but a
war dance, as that month would be most favorable in that climate for
getting ready to attack their neighbors and enemies. He says that these
Saliens "sont v√™tus de robes de diverses couleurs, ceints de baudriers
d'airain." These would seem to have been a sort of medicine cord with
plates of brass affixed which would rattle when shaken by the
dancer.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

is sent for, who binds a parcel of ropes and coral and other trash about

<h3>THE MAGIC WIND KNOTTED CORDS OF THE LAPPS AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p>"The navigators of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have
related many wonderful stories about the magic of the <i>Finns</i> or <i>Finno</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
<i>Lappes</i>, who sold wind contained in a cord with three knots. If the
first were untied, the wind became favourable, if the second, still more
so, but, if the third were loosed, a tempest was the inevitable
consequence."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
The selling of wind knots was ascribed not only to the
Lapps and Finns, but to the inhabitants of Greenland
also.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> "The
northern shipmasters are such dupes to the delusions of these impostors
that they often purchase of them a magic cord which contains a
number of knots, by opening of which, according to the magician's directions,

want."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
"They [Lapland
witches] further confessed, that while they fastened three knots on a
linen towel in the name of the devil, and had spit on them, &amp;c., they
called the name of him they doomed to destruction." They also
claimed that, "by some fatal contrivance they could bring on men disorders,"

<h3>ROSARIES AND OTHER MNEMONIC CORDS.</h3>

<p>The rosary being confessedly an aid to memory, it will be proper to
include it in a chapter descriptive of the different forms of mnemonic
cords which have been noticed in various parts of the world. The use
of the rosary is not confined to Roman Catholics; it is in service among
Mahometans, Tibetans, and
Persians.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Picart mentions "chaplets"
among the Chinese and Japanese which very strongly suggest the
izze-kloth.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>Father Gr√©billon, in his account of Tartary, alludes several times to
the importance attached by the Chinese and Tartars to the privilege of
being allowed to touch the "string of beads" worn by certain Lamas
met on the journey, which corresponds very closely to the rosaries
of the Roman Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mr. Astle informs us that the first Chinese letters were knots on
cords."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the ancient Japanese, the Chinese chronicles relate:
"They have no writing, but merely cut certain marks upon wood and
make knots in cord."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
In the very earliest myths of the Chinese we
read of "knotted cords, which they used instead of characters, and to
instruct their children."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
Malte-Brun calls attention to the fact that
"the hieroglyphics and little cords in use amongst the ancient Chinese
recall in a striking manner the figured writing of the Mexicans and
the Quipos of Peru."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
"Each combination [of the quipu] had, however,
a fixed ideographic value in a certain branch of knowledge, and
thus the <i>quipu</i> differed essentially from the Catholic rosary, the Jewish
phylactery, or the knotted strings of the natives of North America and
Siberia, to all of which it has at times been
compared."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>E. B. Tylor differs in opinion from Brinton. According to Tylor,
"the quipu is a near relation of the rosary and the
wampum-string."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>The use of knotted cords by natives of the Caroline Islands, as a
means of preserving a record of time, is noted by Kotzebue in several
places. For instance: "Kadu kept his journal by moons, for which he
made a knot in a
string."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>During the years of my service with the late Maj. Gen. Crook in the
Southwest, I was surprised to discover that the Apache scouts kept
records of the time of their absence on campaign. There were several
methods in vogue, the best being that of colored beads, which were
strung on a string, six white ones to represent the days of the week
and one black or other color to stand for Sundays. This method gave
rise to some confusion, because the Indians had been told that there
were four weeks, or Sundays ("Domingos"), in each "Luna," or moon,
and yet they soon found that their own method of determining time by
the appearance of the crescent moon was much the more satisfactory.
Among the Zu√±i I have seen little tally sticks with the marks for the
days and months incised on the narrow edges, and among the Apache
another method of indicating the flight of time by marking on a piece
of paper along a horizontal line a number of circles or of straight lines
across the horizontal datum line to represent the full days which had
passed, a heavy straight line for each Sunday, and a small crescent for
the beginning of each month.</p>

<p>Farther to the south, in the Mexican state of Sonora, I was shown,
some twenty years ago, a piece of buckskin, upon which certain Opata
or Yaqui Indians&mdash;I forget exactly which tribe, but it matters very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
little, as they are both industrious and honest&mdash;had kept account of
the days of their labor. There was a horizontal datum line, as before,
with complete circles to indicate full days and half circles to indicate
half days, a long heavy black line for Sundays and holidays, and a
crescent moon for each new month. These accounts had to be drawn
up by the overseer or superintendent of the rancho at which the Indians
were employed before the latter left for home each night.</p>


<h3>THE SACRED CORDS OF THE PARSIS AND BRAHMANS.</h3>

<p>I have already apologized for my own ignorance in regard to the
origin and symbolical signification of the izze-kloth of the Apache,
and I have now to do the same thing for the writers who have referred
to the use by the religious of India of the sacred cords with which, under
various names, the young man of the Parsis or Brahmans is invested
upon attaining the requisite age. No two accounts seem to agree and,
as I have never been in India and cannot presume to decide where so
many differ, it is best that I should lay before my readers the exact
language of the authorities which seem to be entitled to greatest consideration.</p>

<p>"A sacred thread girdle (k√ªst√Æk), should it be made of silk, is not
proper; the hair of a hairy goat and a hairy camel is proper, and from
other hairy creatures it is proper among the
lowly."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Every Parsi wears "a triple coil" of a "white cotton girdle," which
serves to remind him of the "three precepts of his morality&mdash;'good
thoughts,' 'good words,' 'good
deeds.'"<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>Williams describes the sacred girdle of the P&#257;rs&#299;s as made "of seventy-two
interwoven woollen threads, to denote the seventy-two chapters of
the Yasna, but has the appearance of a long flat cord of pure white wool,
which is wound round the body in three coils." The P&#257;rs&#299; must take
off this kust&#299; five times daily and replace it with appropriate prayers.
It must be wound round the body three times and tied in two peculiar
knots, the secret of which is known only to the
P&#257;rs&#299;s.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>According to Picart, the "sudra," or sacred cord of the P&#257;rs&#299;s, has
four knots, each of which represents a
precept.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Marco Polo, in speaking of the Brahmans of India, says: "They are
known by a cotton thread, which they wear over the shoulders, tied
under the arm, crossing the
breast."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>Picart described the sacred cord of the Brahmans, which he calls the
Dsandhem, as made in three colors, each color of nine threads of cotton,
which only the Brahmans have the right to make. It is to be worn after
the manner of a scarf from the left shoulder to the right side. It must
be worn through life, and, as it will wear out, new ones are provided at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
a feast during the month of August.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
The Brahman "about the age of
seven or nine ... is invested with 'the triple cord,' and a badge
which hangs from his left
shoulder."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>The Upavita or sacred cord, wound round the shoulders of the Brahmans,
is mentioned in the Hibbert Lectures on the Origin and Growth
of Religion. "Primarily, the sacred cord was the distinguishing mark of
caste among the Aryan inhabitants. It consisted for the Brahmans of
three cotton threads; for the Kshatriyas or warriors of three hempen
threads; and for the Vaisyas or artisans and tradesmen of woollen
threads."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>"All coiling roots and fantastic shrubs represent the serpent and are
recognized as such all over India. In Bengal we find at the present
day the fantastically growing Euphorbia antiquorum regularly worshipped,
as the representative of the serpent god. The sacred thread,
worn alike by Hindoo and Zoroastrian, is the symbol of that old faith;
the Brahman twines it round his body and occasionally around the neck
of the sacred bull, the Lingam, and its altar.... With the
orthodox, the serpent thread should reach down to its closely allied
faith, although this Ophite thread idea is now no more known to Hindoos
than the origin of arks, altars, candles, spires, and our church
fleur-de-lis to Jews and
Christians."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>General Forlong alludes to the thigh as the symbol of phallic worship. "The serpent
on head denoted Holiness, Wisdom, and Power, as it does when placed on gods
and great ones of the East still; but the Hindoo and Zoroastrian very early adopted
a symbolic thread instead of the ophite deity, and the throwing of this over the
head is also a very sacred rite, which consecrates the man-child to his God; this I
should perhaps have earlier described, and will do so now. The adoption of the
Poita or sacred thread, called also the <i>Zenar</i>, and from the most ancient pre-historic
times by these two great Bactro-Aryan families, points to a period when both had
the same faith, and that faith the Serpent. The Investiture is the Confirmation
or second birth of the Hindoo boy; until which he can not, of course, be married.
After the worship of the heavenly stone&mdash;the S&#257;ligr&#257;ma, the youth or child takes a
branch of the Vilwa tree in his right hand, and a mystic cloth-bag in the left, when
a Poita is formed of three fibres of the Sooroo tree (for the first cord must always
be made of the <i>genuine living fibres</i> of an orthodox tree), and this is hung to the boy's
left shoulder; he then raises the Vilwa branch over his right shoulder, and so stands
for some time, <i>a complete figure</i> of the old faiths in Tree and Serpent, until the priest
offers up various prayers and incantations to Soorya, Savitri or Sot, the Eternal God.
The Sooroo-Poita is then removed as not durable enough, and the permanent thread
is put over the neck. It also is formed of three threads, each 96 cubits or 48 yards
long, folded and twisted together until only so long that, when thrown over the
left shoulder, it extends half-way down the right thigh, or a little less; for the object
appears to be to unite the Caput, Sol, or Seat of intellect with that of passion,
and so form a perfect man."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>All Parsis wear the sacred thread of serpent and phallic extraction, and the investiture
of this is a solemn and essential rite with both sects [i.e., the Hindus and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
Parsis], showing their joint Aryan origin in high Asia, for the thread is of the very
highest antiquity. The Parsi does not, however, wear his thread across the shoulder,
and knows nothing of the all-but-forgotten origin of its required length. He wears
it next to his skin, tied carefully round the waist, and used to tie it round his right
arm, as is still the custom with some classes of Brahmins who have lost purity of
caste by intermarriage with lower
classes.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>At the baptism or investiture of the thread, which takes the place of the Christian
confirmation ceremony, but between the ages of 7 and 9, Fire and Water are the
great sanctifying elements, and are the <i>essentials</i>. The fire is kindled from the
droppings of the sacred cow, then sprinkled over with holy water and blessed; and
when so consecrated by the priest it is called "Holy
Fire."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"The <i>Brahmans</i>, the <i>Rajas</i>, and the <i>Merchants</i>, distinguish themselves
from the various casts of Sudras by a narrow belt of thread, which they
always wear suspended from the left shoulder to the opposite haunch
like a sash."<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
But, as Dubois speaks of the division of all the tribes
into "Right-hand and Left-hand," a distinction which
Coleman<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> explains
as consisting in doing exactly contrariwise of each other, it is
not a very violent assumption to imagine that both the present and a
former method of wearing the izze-kloth, akin to that now followed by
the Apache, may once have obtained in India. The sectaries of the
two Hands are bitterly antagonistic and often indulge in fierce quarrels,
ending in bloodshed.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>"All the Brahmans wear a Cord over the shoulder, consisting of three
black twists of cotton, each of them formed of several smaller threads....
The three threads are not twisted together, but separate from
one another, and hang from the left shoulder to the right haunch.
When a Brahman marries, he mounts nine threads instead of three."
Children were invested with these sacred cords at the age of from 7
to 9. The cords had to be made and put on with much ceremony, and
only Brahmans could make them. According to Dubois, the material
was cotton; he does not allude to
buckskin.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>Coleman<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
gives a detailed description of the manner in which the
sacred thread of the Brahmans is made:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sacred thread must be made by a Brahman. It consists of three strings, each
ninety-six hands (forty-eight yards), which are twisted together: it is then folded
into three and again twisted; these are a second time folded into the same number
and tied at each end in knots. It is worn over the left shoulder (next the skin, extending
half way down the right thigh), by the Brahmans, Ketries and Vaisya castes.
The first are usually invested with it at eight years of age, the second at eleven, and
the Vaisya at twelve.... The Hindus of the Sutra caste do not receive the
poita.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ceremony of investiture comprehends prayer, sacrifice, fasting,
etc., and the wearing of a preliminary poita "of three threads, made of
the fibers of the <i>suru</i>, to which a piece of deer's skin is
fastened."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
This piece of buckskin was added no doubt in order to let the neophyte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
know that once buckskin formed an important part of the garment.
The Brahmans use three cords, while the Apache employ four; on this
subject we shall have more to learn when we take up the subject of
numbers.</p>

<p>Maurice says that the "sacred cord of India," which he calls the
zennar, is "a cord of three threads in memory and honor of the three
great deities of Hindostan."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
It "can be woven by no profane hand; the
Brahmin alone can twine the hallowed threads that compose it and it
is done by him with the utmost solemnity, and with the addition of
many mystic rites."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
It corresponds closely to the izze-kloth; the Apache
do not want people to touch these cords. The zennar "being put
upon the left shoulder passes to the right side and hangs down as low
as the fingers can
reach."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
The izze-kloth of the Apache, when possible,
is made of twisted antelope skin; they have no cord of hemp;
but when the zennar is "put on for the first time, it is accompanied
with a piece of the skin of an antelope, three fingers in breadth, but
shorter than the zennar."<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>On p. 128 of Vining's An Inglorious Columbus, there is a figure of
worshipers offering gifts to Buddha; from Buddha's left shoulder to
his right hip there passes what appears to be a cord, much like the
izze-kloth of the Apache.</p>

<p>Examples of the use of such cords are to be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the conjuration of one of the shamans, "They took a small line
made of deers' skins of four fathoms long, and with a small knot the
priest made it fast about his neck and under his left arm, and gave it
unto two men standing on both sides of him, which held the ends
together."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
It is difficult to say whether this was a cord used on the
present occasion only or worn constantly by the shaman. In either
case the cord was "medicine."</p>

<p>Hagennaar relates that he "saw men wearing ropes with knots in
them, flung over their shoulders, whose eyes turned round in their
heads, and who were called Jammaboos, signifying as much as conjurors
or exorcists."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>The Mahometans believe that at the day of judgment Jesus Christ
and Mahomet are to meet outside of Jerusalem holding a tightly-stretched
cord between them upon which all souls must walk. This
may or may not preserve a trace of a former use of such a cord in their
"medicine," but it is well to refer to
it.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>The sacred thread and garment which were worn by all the perfect
among the Cathari, and the use of which by both Zends and Brahmans
shows that its origin is to be traced back to a pre-historic
period.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>In explaining the rules of external purification&mdash;that is, purification
in which water is the medium&mdash;Baudh√¢yana
says:<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The sacrificial thread (shall be made) of Kusa grass, or cotton, (and consist) of
thrice three strings.</p>

<p>(It shall hang down) to the navel.</p>

<p>(In putting it on) he shall raise the right arm, lower the left, and lower the head.</p>

<p>The contrary (is done at sacrifices) to the manes.</p>

<p>(If the thread is) suspended around the neck (it is called) nivita.</p>

<p>(If it is) suspended below (the navel, it is called) adhopavita.</p></blockquote>

<p>A former use of sacred cords would seem to be suggested in the constant
appearance of the belief in the mystical properties and the power
for good or evil of the knots which constitute the characteristic appendage
of these cords. This belief has been confined to no race or people;
it springs up in the literature of the whole world and survives with a
pertinacity which is remarkable among the peasantry of Europe and
among many in both America and Europe who would not hesitate to
express resentment were they to be included among the illiterate.</p>

<p>The powers of these knots were recognized especially in strengthening
or defeating love, as aiding women in labor, and in other ways which
prove them to be cousins-german to the magic knots with which the
medicine-men of the Lapps and other nations along the shores of the
Baltic were supposed to be able to raise or allay the tempest. "One of
the torments with which witchcraft worried men was the Knot by which
a man was withheld so that he could not work his will with a woman.
It was called in the Latin of the times Nodus and Obligamentum, and
appears in the glossaries, translated by the Saxons into lyb, drug."
"To make a 'ligatura' is pronounced 'detestable' by Theodoras, Archbishop
of Canterbury, in 668. The knot is still known in France, and
Nouer l'aiguillette is a resort of ill-will." Then is given the adventure
of Hrut, prince of Iceland, and his bride Gunnhilld, princess of Norway,
by whom a "knot" was duly tied to preserve his fidelity during
his absence.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>

"A knot among the ancient northern nations seems to have been the
symbol of love, faith, and friendship, pointing out the indissoluble tie
of affection and duty. Thus the ancient Runic inscriptions, as we
gather from Hickes's Thesaurus, are in the form of a knot. Hence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
among the northern English and Scots, who still retain, in a great
measure, the language and manners of the ancient Danes, that curious
kind of a knot, a mutual present between the lover and his mistress,
which, being considered as the emblem of plighted fidelity, is therefore
called a true-love knot: a name which is not derived, as one would
naturally suppose it to be, from the words 'true' and 'love,' but formed
from the Danish verb <i>Trulofa, fidem do</i>, I plight my troth, or faith....
Hence, evidently, the bride favors or the top-knots at marriages,
which have been considered as emblems of the ties of duty and affection
between the bride and her spouse, have been
derived."<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

is much magnified, and still retained in presents of love among us;
which, though in all points it doth not make out, had, perhaps, its
original from Nodus Herculanus, or that which was called Hercules, his
knot resembling the snaky complications in the caduceus or rod of Hermes
and in which form the zone or woolen girdle of the bride was fastened,
as Turnebus observes in his Adversaria." Brand

true-lover's knot had to be tied three times. Another species of knot divination
is given in the Connoisseur, No. 56: "Whenever I go to lye in
a strange bed, I always tye my garter nine times round the bed-post,
and knit nine knots in it, and say to myself: 'this knot I knit, this
knot I tye, to see my love as he goes by,' etc. There was also a suggestion
of color symbolism in the true-lover's knot, blue being generally
accepted as the most appropriate tint. I find among the illiterate Mexican
population of the lower Rio Grande a firm belief in the power possessed
by a lock of hair tied into knots to retain a maiden's affections.</p>

<h3>USE OF CORDS AND KNOTS AND GIRDLES IN PARTURITION.</h3>

<p>Folk medicine in all regions is still relying upon the potency of mystical
cords and girdles to facilitate labor. The following are a few of
the many examples which might be presented:</p>

<p>Delivery was facilitated if the man by whom the woman has conceived
unties his girdle, and, after tying it round her, unties it, saying:
"I have tied it and I will untie it," and then takes his
departure.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>"Henry, in his History of Britain, vol. 1, p. 459, tells us that 'amongst
the ancient Britons, when a birth was attended with any difficulty, they
put certain girdles made for that purpose about the women in labour
which they imagined gave immediate and effectual relief. Such girdles
were kept with care till very lately in many families in the Highlands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
of Scotland. They were impressed with several mystical figures; and
the ceremony of binding them about the woman's waist was accompanied
with words and gestures, which showed the custom to have
been of great antiquity, and to have come originally from the
Druids.'"<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>"But my girdle shall serve as a riding <i>knit</i>, and a fig for all the
witches in Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
The use of girdles in labor must be ancient.</p>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut mulier concipiat, homo vir si solvat semicinctum suum et eam
pr√¶cingat."<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
"Certum est quod partum mirabiliter facilirent, siveinstar
cinguli circumdentur corpori.</span>" These girdles were believed to aid labor
and cure dropsy and urinary
troubles.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>"The following customs of childbirth are noticed in the Trait√© des
Superstitions of M. Thiers, vol. 1, p. 320: '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lors qu'une femme est preste
d'accoucher, prendre <i>sa ceinture</i>, aller √† l'Eglise, <i>lier la cloche avec cette
ceinture</i> et la faire sonner trois coups afin que cette femme accouche
heureusement. Martin de Arles, Archidiacre de Pampelonne (Tract.
de Superstition) asseure que cette superstition est fort en usage dans
tout son pays.</span>'"<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>In the next two examples there is to be found corroboration of the
views advanced by Forlong that these cords (granting that the principle
upon which they all rest is the same) had originally some relation
to ophic rites. Brand adds from Levinus Lemnius: "Let the woman
that travels with her child (is in her labour) be girded with the skin
that a serpent or a snake casts off, and then she will quickly be
delivered."<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
A serpent's skin was tied as a belt about a woman in childbirth. "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inde

<p>The following examples, illustrative of the foregoing, are taken from
Flemming: The skins of human corpses were drawn off, preferably by
cobblers, tanned, and made into girdles, called "Cingula" or Chirothec√¶,
which were bound on the left thigh of a woman in labor to expedite
delivery. The efficacy of these was highly extolled, although
some writers recommended a recourse to tiger's skin for the purposes
indicated. This "caro humano" was euphemistically styled "mummy"
or "mumia" by Von Helmont and others of the early pharmacists, when
treating of it as an internal medicament.</p>

<p>There was a "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cingulum ex corio humano</span>" bound round patients during
epileptic attacks, convulsions, childbirth, etc., and another kind of belt described
as "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cute humana conficiunt</span>," and used in contraction of the
nerves and rheumatism of the
joints,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>

<h3>"MEDIDAS," "MEASURING CORDS," "WRESTING THREADS," ETC.</h3>

<p>Black says:<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
"On the banks of the Ale and the Teviot the women
have still a custom of wearing round their necks blue woollen threads or
cords till they wean their children, doing this for the purpose of averting
ephemeral fevers. These cords are handed down from mother to
daughter, and esteemed in proportion to their antiquity. Probably
these cords had originally received some blessing."</p>

<p>Black's surmise is well founded. These cords were, no doubt, the same
as the "medidas" or measurements of the holy images of Spain and other
parts of Continental Europe. "The ribands or serpent symbols [of
Our Lady of Montserrat] are of silk, and exactly the span of the Virgin's
head, and on them is printed '<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">medida de la cabeza de Nuestra
Se√±ora Maria Sant√≠sima de Montserrat</i>,' i.e., exact head measurement
of Our Lady of Montserrat."<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>These same "medidas" may be found in full vogue in the outlying
districts of Mexico to-day. Twenty years ago I saw them at the
"funcion" of San Francisco, in the little town of Magdalena, in Sonora.
I watched carefully to see exactly what the women did and observed
that the statue of St. Francis (which, for greater convenience,
was exposed outside of the church, where the devout could reach it
without disturbing the congregation within) was measured from head
to foot with pieces of ribbon, which were then wrapped up and packed
away. In reply to my queries, I learned that the "medida" of the
head was a specific for headache, that of the waist for all troubles in
the abdominal region, those of the legs, arms, and other parts for the
ailments peculiar to each of them respectively. This was in a community
almost, if not absolutely, Roman Catholic; but in the thoroughly
Protestant neighborhood of Carlisle, Pa., the same superstition exists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
in full vigor, as I know personally. Three years ago my second
child was suffering from the troubles incident to retarded dentition and
had to be taken to the mountains at Holly Springs, within sight of
Carlisle. I was begged and implored by the women living in the place
to have the child taken to "a wise woman" to be "measured," and was
assured that some of the most intelligent people in that part of the
country were firm believers in the superstition. When I declined to
lend countenance to such nonsense I was looked upon as a brutal and
unnatural parent, caring little for the welfare of his offspring.</p>

<p>Miss Edna Dean Proctor, the poet, told me, June 9, 1887, that some
years ago, while visiting relations in Illinois, she met a woman who,
having been ill for a long time, had despaired of recovery, and in hope
of amelioration had consulted a man pretending to occult powers, who
prescribed that she wear next the skin a certain knotted red cord which
he gave her.</p>

<p>On a previous page the views of Forlong have been presented, showing
that there were reasons for believing that the sacred cords of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
East Indies could be traced back to an ophic origin, and it has also
been shown that, until the present day, among the peasantry of Europe,
there has obtained the practice of making girdles of snake skin which
have been employed for the cure of disease and as an assistance in
childbirth. The snake itself, while still alive, as has been shown, is
applied to the person of the patient by the medicine-men of the American
Indians.</p>

<p>In connection with the remarks taken from Forlong's Rivers of Life
on this subject, I should like to call attention to the fact that the long
knotted blacksnake whip of the wagoners of Europe and America,
which, when not in use, is worn across the body from shoulder to hip,
has been identified as related to snake worship.</p>

<p>There is another view to take of the origin of these sacred cords
which it is fair to submit before passing final judgment. The izze-kloth
may have been in early times a cord for tying captives who were taken
in war, and as these captives were offered up in sacrifice to the gods of
war and others they were looked upon as sacred, and all used in connection
with them would gradually take on a sacred character. The
same kind of cords seem to have been used in the chase. This would
explain a great deal of the superstition connected with the whole subject
of "hangman's rope" bringing luck, curing disease, and averting
trouble of all sorts, a superstition more widely disseminated and going
back to more ancient times than most people would imagine. One of
the tribes of New Granada, "quando iban √† la Guerra llevaban Cordeles
para atar √† los Presos."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
This recalls that the Apache themselves
used to throw lariats from ambush upon travelers, and that the
Thugs who served the goddess Bhowani, in India, strangled with cords,
afterwards with handkerchiefs. The Spaniards in Peru, under Jorge
Robledo, going toward the Rio Magdalena, in 1542, found a large body
of savages "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">que llevaban Cordeles, para atar √† los Castellanos, i sus

animal and provided with the following charm to aid him in his
search: "The rope with which the legs of the lost animal had been fettered
was rolled betwixt his (the Ras el K√°filah's) hands, and sundry
cabalistic words having been muttered whilst the Devil was dislodged

by the process of spitting upon the cord at the termination of each
spell, it was finally delivered over to the Dank√°li about to be sent on
the quest." Stanley describes the "lords of the cord" at the court of
Mtesa, king of Uganda, but they seem to be provost officers and executioners
merely.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>

<h3>UNCLASSIFIED SUPERSTITIONS UPON THIS SUBJECT.</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to present some of the instances occurring in my
studies which apparently have a claim to be included in a treatise upon
the subject of sacred cords and knots. These examples are presented
without comment, as they are, to all intents and purposes, "survivals,"
which have long ago lost their true significance. Attention is invited
to the fact that the very same use seems to be made by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
Irish of hair cords as we have already seen has been made by the
Australians.</p>

<p>The Jewish garment with knots at the corners would appear to have
been a prehistoric garment preserved in religious ceremonial; it would
seem to be very much like the short blanket cloak, with tufts or knots
at the four corners, still made by and in use among the Zu√±i, Navajo,
Tusayan, and Rio Grande Pueblos. But magic knots were by no means
unknown to Jews, Assyrians, or other nations of Syria and Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>"In Memorable Things noted in the Description of the World, we
read: About children's necks the wild Irish hung the beginning of St.
John's Gospel, a crooked nail of a horseshoe, or a piece of a wolve's
skin, and both the sucking child and nurse were girt with girdles finely
plaited with woman's
hair."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Gainsford, in his Glory of England, speaking of the Irish, p. 150,
says: "They use <i>incantations</i> and <i>spells</i>, wearing <i>girdles of woman's
haire</i>, and <i>locks of their lover's</i>."</p>

<p>Camden, in his Ancient and Modern Manners of the Irish, says that
"they are observed to present their lovers with bracelets of women's
hair, whether in reference to Venus' cestus or not, I know
not."<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>

<p>A variant of the same formula is to be found in Fran√ßois Lenormant's
Chaldean Magic.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
Lenormant speaks of the Chaldean use of "magic
knots, the efficacy of which was so firmly believed in even up to the
middle ages."</p>

<p>Again, he says that magic cords, with knots, were "still very common
among the Nabathean sorcerers of the Lower Euphrates," in the fourteenth
century, and in his opinion the use of these was derived from
the ancient Chaldeans. In still another place he speaks of the "magic
knots" used by Finnish conjurors in curing diseases.</p>

<p>"The Jewish phylactery was tied in a knot, but more generally knots
are found in use to bring about some enchantment or disenchantment.
Thus in an ancient Babylonian charm we have&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>'Merodach, the Son of Hea, the prince, with his holy hands cuts the knots.'</p></blockquote>

<p>That is to say, he takes off the evil influence of the knots. So,
too, witches sought in Scotland to compass evil by tying knots.
Witches, it was thought, could supply themselves with the milk of
any neighbor's cows if they had a small quantity of hair from the tail
of each of the animals. The hair they would twist into a rope and then
a knot would be tied on the rope for every cow which had contributed
hair. Under the clothes of a witch who was burned at St. Andrews, in
1572, was discovered 'a white claith, like a collore craig, with stringis,
wheron was mony knottis vpon the stringis of the said collore craig.'
When this was taken from her, with a prescience then wrongly interpreted,
she said: 'Now I have no hope of myself.' 'Belyke scho
thought,' runs the cotemporary account, 'scho suld not have died,
that being vpon her,' but probably she meant that to be discovered
with such an article in her possession was equivalent to the sentence of
death. So lately as the beginning of the last century, two persons
were sentenced to capital punishment for stealing a charm of knots,
made by a woman as a device against the welfare of Spalding of
Ashintilly."<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

belt and the cord which in Burmah is hung round the neck of a
possessed person while he is being thrashed to drive out the spirit
which troubles him? Theoretically the thrashing is given to the
spirit, and not to the man, but to prevent the spirit escaping too soon
a charmed cord is hung round the possessed person's neck. When the

<h3>THE MEDICINE HAT.</h3>

<p>The medicine hat of the old and blind Apache medicine-man, Nan-ta-do-tash,
was an antique affair of buckskin, much begrimed with soot
and soiled by long use. Nevertheless, it gave life and strength to him
who wore it, enabled the owner to peer into the future, to tell who had
stolen ponies from other people, to foresee the approach of an enemy,
and to aid in the cure of the sick. This was its owner's own statement
in conversation with me, but it would seem that the power residing in
the helmet or hat was not very permanent, because when the old man
discovered from his wife that I had made a rude drawing of it he
became extremely excited and said that such a delineation would
destroy all the life of the hat. His fears were allayed by presents of
money and tobacco, as well as by some cakes and other food. As a
measure of precaution, he insisted upon sprinkling pinches of hoddentin
over myself, the hat, and the drawing of it, at the same time muttering
various half-articulate prayers. He returned a month afterwards and
demanded the sum of $30 for damage done to the hat by the drawing,
since which time it has ceased to "work" when needed.</p>

<p>This same old man gave me an explanation of all the symbolism
depicted upon the hat and a great deal of valuable information in
regard to the profession of medicine-men, their specialization, the
prayers they recited, etc. The material of the hat, as already stated,
was buckskin. How that was obtained I can not assert positively, but
from an incident occurring under my personal observation in the Sierra
Madre in Mexico in 1883, where our Indian scouts and the medicine-men
with them surrounded a nearly grown fawn and tried to capture
it alive, as well as from other circumstances too long to be here inserted,
I am of the opinion that the buckskin to be used for sacred purposes
among the Apache must, whenever possible, be that of a strangled
animal, as is the case, according to Dr. Matthews, among the Navajo.</p>

<p>The body of Nan-ta-do-tash's cap (Fig. 434, p. 503) was unpainted, but
the figures upon it were in two colors, a brownish yellow and an earthy
blue, resembling a dirty Prussian blue. The ornamentation was of the
downy feathers and black-tipped plumes of the eagle, pieces of abalone
shell, and chalchihuitl, and a snake's rattle on the apex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>
<p>Nan-ta-do-tash explained that the characters on the medicine hat
meant: A, clouds; B, rainbow; C, hail; E, morning-star; F, the God of
Wind, with his lungs; G, the black "kan"; H, great stars or suns.</p>

<p>"Kan" is the name given to their principal gods. The appearance
of the kan himself and of the tail of the hat suggest the centipede, an
important animal god of the Apache. The old man said that the figures
represented the powers to which he appealed for aid in his "medicine"
and the kan upon whom he called for help. There were other doctors
with other medicines, but he used none but those of which he was going
to speak to me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Fig.
440.&mdash;Apache war bonnet.</span>
</div>

<p>When an Apache or other medicine-man is in full regalia he ceases
to be a man, but becomes, or tries to make his followers believe that he
has become, the power he represents. I once heard this asserted in a
very striking way while I was with a party of Apache young men who
had led me to one of the sacred caves of their people, in which we came
across a great quantity of ritualistic paraphernalia of all sorts.</p>

<p>"We used to stand down here," they said, "and look up to the top
of the mountain and see the kan come down." This is precisely what
the people living farther to the south told the early Spanish missionaries.

<p>The Mexicans were wont to cry out "Here come our gods!" upon
seeing their priests masked and disguised, and especially when they
had donned the skins of the women offered up in
sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>The headdresses worn by the gods of the American Indians and the
priests or medicine-men who served them were persistently called "miters"
by the early Spanish writers. Thus Quetzalcoatl wore "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">en la
cabe√ßa una Mitra de papel
puntiaguda</span>."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
When Father Felician Lopez
went to preach to the Indians of Florida, in 1697, among other matters
of record is one to the effect that "the chief medicine man called himself

Possibly this title was assumed because the medicine-men
wore "miters."</p>

<p>Duran goes further than his fellows. In the headdress used at the
spirit dances he recognizes the tiara. He says that the Mexican priests
at the feast of Tezcatlipoca wore "en las cabezas tiaras hechas de
barillas."<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
The ghost dance headdress illustrated in this paper (Fig. 441) is
known to the Chiricahua Apache as the "ich-te," a contraction from
"chas-a-i-wit-te," according to Ramon, the old medicine-man from whom
I obtained it. He explained all the symbolism connected with it. The
round piece of tin in the center is the sun; the irregular arch underneath
it is the rainbow. Stars and lightning are depicted on the side
slats and under them; the parallelograms with serrated edges are
clouds; the pendant green sticks are rain drops; there are snakes and
snake heads on both horizontal and vertical slats, the heads in the
former case being representative of hail.</p>

<p>There are feathers of the eagle to conciliate that powerful bird, turkey
feathers to appeal to the mountain spirits, and white gull feathers
for the spirits of the water. There are also small pieces of nacreous
shells and one or two fragments of the "duklij," or chalchihuitl, without
which no medicine-man would feel competent to discharge his functions.</p>

<p>The spirit dance itself is called "cha-ja-la." I have seen this dance a
number of times, but will confine my description to one seen at Fort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
Marion (St. Augustine, Fla.), in 1887, when the Chiricahua Apache were
confined there as prisoners; although the accompanying figure represents
a ghost dance headdress seen among the Apache in the winter of
1885. A great many of the band had been suffering from sickness of
one kind or another and twenty-three of the children had died; as a
consequence, the medicine-men were having the Cha-ja-la, which is entered
into only upon the most solemn occasions, such as the setting out
of a war party, the appearance of an epidemic, or something else of like
portent. On the terreplein of the northwest bastion, Ramon, the old
medicine-man, was violently beating upon a drum, which, as usual, had
been improvised of a soaped rag drawn tightly over the mouth of an iron
kettle holding a little water.</p>

<p>Although acting as master of ceremonies, Ramon was not painted or
decorated in any way. Three other medicine-men were having the finishing
touches put to their bodily decoration. They had an under-coating
of greenish brown, and on each arm a yellow snake, the head toward
the shoulder blade. The snake on the arm of one of the party
was double-headed, or rather had a head at each extremity.</p>

<p>Each had insignia in yellow on back and breast, but no two were exactly
alike. One had on his breast a yellow bear, 4 inches long by 3 inches
high, and on his back a kan of the same color and dimensions. A second
had the same pattern of bear on his breast, but a zigzag for lightning
on his back. The third had the zigzag on both back and breast.
All wore kilts and moccasins.</p>

<p>While the painting was going on Ramon thumped and sang with vigor
to insure the medicinal potency of the pigments and the designs to
which they were applied. Each held, one in each hand, two wands or
swords of lathlike proportions, ornamented with snake-lightning in blue.</p>

<p>The medicine-men emitted a peculiar whistling noise and bent slowly
to the right, then to the left, then frontward, then backward, until the
head in each case was level with the waist. Quickly they spun round
in full circle on the left foot; back again in a reverse circle to the right;
then they charged around the little group of tents in that bastion, making
cuts and thrusts with their wands to drive the maleficent spirits
away.</p>

<p>It recalled to my mind the old myths of the angel with the flaming
sword guarding the entrance to Eden, or of St. Michael chasing the discomfited
Lucifer down into the depths of Hell.</p>

<p>These preliminaries occupied a few moments only; at the end of that
time the medicine-men advanced to where a squaw was holding up to
them a little baby sick in its cradle. The mother remained kneeling
while the medicine-men frantically struck at, upon, around, and over the
cradle with their wooden weapons.</p>

<p>The baby was held so as successively to occupy each of the cardinal
points and face each point directly opposite; first on the east side, facing
the west; then the north side, facing the south; then the west side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
facing the east; then the south side, facing the north, and back to the
original position. While at each position, each of the medicine-men in
succession, after making all the passes and gestures described, seized
the cradle in his hands, pressed it to his breast, and afterwards lifted it
up to the sky, next to the earth, and lastly to the four cardinal points,
all the time prancing, whistling, and snorting, the mother and her squaw
friends adding to the dismal din by piercing shrieks and ululations.</p>

<p>That ended the ceremonies for that night so far as the baby personally
was concerned, but the medicine-men retired down to the parade
and resumed their saltation, swinging, bending, and spinning with such
violence that they resembled, in a faint way perhaps, the Dervishes of
the East. The understanding was that the dance had to be kept up as
long as there was any fuel unconsumed of the large pile provided; any
other course would entail bad luck. It was continued for four nights,
the colors and the symbols upon the bodies varying from night to night.
Among the modes of exorcism enumerated by Burton, we find "cutting
the air with swords."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
Picart speaks of the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fl√™ches ou les baguettes
dont les Arabes Idol√¢tres se servoient pour deviner par le sort</span>." He
says that the diviner "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tenoit √† la main</span>" these arrows, which certainly
suggest the swords or wands of the Apache medicine-men in the spirit
dance.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>There were four medicine-men, three of whom were dancing and in
conference with the spirits, and the fourth of whom was general superintendent
of the whole dance, and the authority to whom the first three
reported the result of their interviews with the ghostly powers.</p>

<p>The mask and headdress of the first of the dancers, who seemed to
be the leading one, was so elaborate that in the hurry and meager light
supplied by the flickering fires it could not be portrayed. It was very
much like that of number three, but so fully covered with the plumage
of the eagle, hawk, and, apparently, the owl, that it was difficult to assert
this positively. Each of these medicine-men had pieces of red flannel
tied to his elbows and a stick about four feet long in each hand.
Number one's mask was spotted black and white and shaped in front
like the snout of a mountain lion. His back was painted with large
arrowheads in brown and white, which recalled the protecting arrows
tightly bound to the backs of Zu√±i fetiches. Number two had on his
back a figure in white ending between the shoulders in a cross. Number
three's back was simply whitened with clay.</p>

<p>All these headdresses were made of slats of the Spanish bayonet, unpainted,
excepting that on number two was a figure in black, which
could not be made out, and that the horizontal crosspieces on number
three were painted blue.</p>

<p>The dominos or masks were of blackened buckskin, for the two
fastened around the neck by garters or sashes; the neckpiece of number
three was painted red; the eyes seemed to be glass knobs or brass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
buttons. These three dancers were naked to the waist, and wore beautiful
kilts of fringed buckskin bound on with sashes, and moccasins
reaching to the knees. In this guise they jumped into the center of the
great circle of spectators and singers and began running about the fire
shrieking and muttering, encouraged by the shouts and the singing, and
by the drumming and incantation of the chorus which now swelled forth
at full lung power.</p>


<h3>THE SPIRIT OR GHOST DANCE HEADDRESS.</h3>

<p>As the volume of music swelled and the cries of the on-lookers became
fiercer, the dancers were encouraged to the enthusiasm of frenzy. They
darted about the circle, going through the motions of looking for an
enemy, all the while muttering, mumbling, and singing, jumping, swaying,
and whirling like the dancing Dervishes of Arabia.</p>

<p>Their actions, at times, bore a very considerable resemblance to the
movements of the Zu√±i Sh√°lako at the Feast of Fire. Klashidu told
me that the orchestra was singing to the four willow branches planted
near them. This would indicate a vestige of tree worship, such as is to
be noticed also at the sun dance of the Sioux.</p>

<p>At intervals, the three dancers would dart out of the ring and disappear
in the darkness, to consult with the spirits or with other medicine-men
seated a considerable distance from the throng.
<ins title="Note: As in the original text">Three several times</ins>
they appeared and disappeared, always dancing, running, and whirling
about with increased energy. Having attained the degree of mental or
spiritual exaltation necessary for communion with the spirits, they took
their departure and kept away for at least half an hour, the orchestra
during their absence rendering a mournful refrain, monotonous as a funeral
dirge. My patience became exhausted and I turned to go to my quarters.
A thrill of excited expectancy ran through the throng of Indians,
and I saw that they were looking anxiously at the returning medicine-men.
All the orchestra now stood up, their leader (the principal medicine-man)
slightly in advance, holding a branch of cedar in his left
hand. The first advanced and bending low his head murmured some
words of unknown import with which the chief seemed to be greatly
pleased. Then the chief, taking his stand in front of the orchestra on
the east side of the grove or cluster of trees, awaited the final ceremony,
which was as follows: The three dancers in file and in proper
order advanced and receded three times; then they embraced the chief
in such a manner that the sticks or wands held in their hands came
behind his neck, after which they mumbled and muttered a jumble of
sounds which I can not reproduce, but which sounded for all the world
like the chant of the "hooter" at the Zu√±i Feast of Fire. They then
pranced or danced through the grove three times. This was repeated
for each point of the compass, the chief medicine-man, with the orchestra,
taking a position successively on the east, south, west, and north
and the three dancers advancing, receding, and embracing as at first.

<span class="caption">Fig. 442.&mdash;Apache kan or gods. (Drawn by Apache.)</span>
</div>

<p>This terminated the "medicine" ceremonies of the evening, the glad
shouts of the Apache testifying that the incantations of their spiritual
leaders or their necromancy, whichever it was, promised a successful
campaign. These dancers were, I believe, dressed up to represent their
gods or kan, but not content with representing them aspired to be mistaken
for them.</p>

<h3>AMULETS AND TALISMANS.</h3>

<h4>THE "TZI-DALTAI."</h4>

<p>The Apache, both men and women, wear amulets, called tzi-daltai, made
of lightning-riven wood, generally pine or cedar or fir from the mountain
tops, which are highly valued and are not to be sold. These are shaved
very thin and rudely cut in the
semblance of the human form.
They are in fact the duplicates, on
a small scale, of the rhombus, already
described. Like the rhombus,
they are decorated with incised
lines representing the lightning.
Very often these are to be
found attached to the necks of
children or to their cradles. Generally
these amulets are of small size. Below will be found figures of
those which I was permitted to examine and depict in their actual size.
They are all unpainted. The amulet represented was obtained from a
Chiricahua Apache captive. Deguele, an Apache of the Klukaydakaydn
clan, consented to exhibit a kan, or god, which he carried about his
person. He said I could have it for three ponies. It was made of a
flat piece of lath, unpainted, of the size here given, having drawn upon
it this figure in yellow, with a narrow black band, excepting the three
snake heads, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, which were black with white eyes; <i>a</i> was a
yellow line and <i>c</i> a black line; flat pearl buttons were fastened at <i>m</i> and
<i>k</i> respectively and small eagle-down feathers at <i>k</i> on each side of the
idol. The rear of the tablet, amulet, or idol, as one may be pleased to
call it, was almost an exact reproduction of the front.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 443.&mdash;Tzi-daltai amulet (Apache).</span>
</div>

<p>The owner of this inestimable treasure assured me that he prayed to
it at all times when in trouble, that he could learn from it where his ponies
were when stolen and which was the right direction to travel when lost,
and that when drought had parched his crops this would never fail to
bring rain in abundance to revive and strengthen them. The symbolism
is the rain cloud and the serpent lightning, the rainbow, rain drops,
and the cross of the four winds.</p>

<p>These small amulets are also to be found inclosed in the phylacteries
(Fig. 447) which the medicine-men wear suspended from their necks or
waists.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, who was a very good witness in all that related to
prehistoric customs and "survivals" among the Celtic Scots, may be
introduced at this point:</p>

<h4>CHALCHIHUITL.</h4>

<p>The articles of dress depicted in this paper are believed to represent
all those which exclusively belong to the office of the Apache
"diyi" or "izze-nantan." Of late years it can not be said that every
medicine-man has all these articles, but most of them will be found in
the possession of the man in full practice.</p>

<p>No matter what the medicine-man may lack, he will, if it be possible,
provide himself with some of the impure malachite known to the whites
of the Southwest as turquoise. In the malachite veins the latter stone
is sometimes found and is often of good quality, but the difference between
the two is apparent upon the slightest examination. The color of
the malachite is a pea green, that of the turquoise a pale sky blue. The
chemical composition of the former is a carbonate of copper, mixed with
earthy impurities; that of the latter, a phosphate of alumina, colored
with the oxide of copper. The use of this malachite was widespread.
Under the name of chalchihuitl or chalchihuite, it appears with frequency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
in the old Spanish writings, as we shall presently see, and
was in all places and by all tribes possessing it revered in much
the same manner as by the
Apache. The Apache call it
duklij, "blue (or green) stone,"
these two colors not being differentiated
in their language. A
small bead of this mineral affixed
to a gun or bow made the weapon
shoot accurately. It had also
some relation to the bringing of
rain, and could be found by the
man who would go to the end of a
rainbow, after a storm, and hunt
diligently in the damp earth. It
was the Apache medicine-man's
badge of office, his medical diploma,
so to speak, and without
it he could not in olden times exercise
his medical functions.</p>

<p>In the curious commerce of the
Indian tribes, some possessed articles of greater worth than those belonging
to their neighbors. In the southwest the red paint sold by the
tribes living in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado was held in higher
repute than any other, and the green
stone to be purchased from the Rio Grande
Pueblos always was in great demand, as it
is to this day. Vetancurt<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
speaks of the
Apache, between the years 1630 and 1680,
coming to the pueblo of Pecos to trade
for "chalchihuites." John de Laet speaks
of "petites pierres verdes" worn in the
lower lip by the
Brazilians.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Among the Mexicans the chalchihuitl
seems to have been the distinguishing
mark or badge of the priesthood. Duran,
in speaking of the consecration of a sacrificial
stone in Mexico by Montezuma the
elder, and his assistant or coadjutor, Tlacaclel,
says: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ech√°ronse √° las espaldas

<p>Among the tribes in Central America, a chalchihuitl was placed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
the mouths of the dying to receive their souls: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">que era para que

<p>One of the Mexican myths of the birth of Quetzalcoatl narrates that
his mother, Chimalma, while sweeping, found a chalchihuitl, swallowed
it, and became pregnant: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Andando barriendo la dicha Chimalma
hall√≥ un chalchihuitl, (que es una pedrezuela verde) y que la trag√≥ y
de esto se empre√±√≥, y que as√≠ pari√≥ al dicho
Quetzalcoatl</span>."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> The same
author tells us that the chalchihuitl (which he calls "pedrezuela
verde") are mentioned in the earliest myths of the
Mexicans.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>In South America the emerald seems to have taken the place of the
chalchihuitl. Bollaert<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
makes frequent mention of the use of the emerald
by the natives of Ecuador and Peru, "a drilled emerald, such as the
Incas wore;" "large emeralds, emblematic of their [the Incas'] sovereignty."</p>

<p>From Torquemada we learn that the Mexicans adorned their idols
with the chalchihuitl, and also that they buried a chalchihuitl with their
dead, saying that it was the dead man's
heart.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>Torquemada<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
repeats the Aztec myth already given from Mendieta.
He says that in 1537 Fray Antonio de Ciudad-Rodrigo, provincial of
the Franciscans, sent friars of his order to various parts of the Indian

<h3>PHYLACTERIES.</h3>

<p>The term phylactery, as herein employed, means any piece of buckskin
or other material upon which are inscribed certain characters or
symbols of a religious or "medicine" nature, which slip or phylactery
is to be worn attached to the person seeking to be benefited by it, and
this phylactery differs from the amulet or talisman in being concealed
from the scrutiny of the profane and kept as secret as possible. This
phylactery, itself "medicine," may be employed to enwrap other "medicine"
and thus augment its own potentiality. Indians in general
object to having their "medicine" scrutinized and touched; in this
there is a wide margin of individual opinion; but in regard to phylacteries
there is none that I have been able to discover, and the rule may
be given as antagonistic to the display of these sacred "relics," as my
Mexican captive interpreter persisted in calling them.</p>

<p>The first phylactery which it was my good fortune to be allowed to
examine was one worn by Ta-ul-tzu-je, of the Kaytzentin gens. It was
tightly rolled in at least half a mile of orange-colored saddlers' silk,
obtained from some of the cavalry posts. After being duly uncovered,
it was found to be a small piece of buckskin two inches square, upon
which were drawn red and yellow crooked lines which the Apache said
represented the red and yellow snake. Inside were a piece of green
chalchihuitl and a small cross of lightning-riven twig (pine) and two
very small perforated shells. The cross was called "intchi-dijin," the
black wind.</p>

<p>A second phylactery which I was also allowed to untie and examine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
belonged to Na-a-cha and consisted of a piece of buckskin of the same
size as the other, but either on account of age or for some other reason
no characters could be discerned upon it. It, however, enwrapped a
tiny bag of hoddentin, which, in its turn, held a small but very clear
crystal of quartz and four feathers of eagle down. Na-a-cha took care
to explain very earnestly that this phylactery contained not merely the
"medicine" or power of the crystal, the hoddentin, and the itza-chu,
or eagle, but also of the shoz-dijiji, or black bear, the shoz-lekay, or
white bear, the shoz-litzogue, or yellow bear, and the klij-litzogue or
yellow snake, though just in what manner he could not explain.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 447.&mdash;Phylacteries.</span>
</div>

<p>It would take up too much time and space to describe the manner
in which it was necessary for me to proceed in order to obtain merely
a glimpse of these and other phylacteries, all of the same general
type; how I had to make it evident that I was myself possessed of great
"medicine" power and able to give presents of great "medicine" value,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
as was the case. I had obtained from cliff dwellings, sacred caves, and
other places beads of talc, of chalchihuitl, and of shell, pieces of crystal
and other things, sacred in the eyes of the Apache, and these I was
compelled to barter for the information here given.</p>

<span class="caption">Plate VIII.<br />
APACHE MEDICINE SHIRT.</span>
</div>

<p>The medicine shirts of the Apaches, several of which are here represented,
do not require an extended description. The symbolism is
different for each one, but may be generalized as typical of the sun,
moon, stars, rainbow, lightning, snake, clouds, rain, hail, tarantula,
centipede, snake, and some one or more of the "kan" or gods.</p>

<p>The medicine sashes follow closely in pattern the medicine shirts,
being smaller in size only, but with the same symbolic decoration.
Similar ornamentation will be found upon the amulets (ditzi), made of
lightning-struck pine or other wood. All of these are warranted, among
other virtues, to screen the wearer from the arrows, lances, or bullets
of the enemy. In this they strongly resemble the salves and other
means by which people in Europe sought to obtain "magical impenetrability."
The last writer to give receipts for making such salves,
etc., that I can recall, was Etm√ºller, who wrote in the early years of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Such as the reader can imagine the medicine-man to be from this
description of his paraphernalia, such he has been since the white man
first landed in America. Never desirous of winning proselytes to his
own ideas, he has held on to those ideas with a tenacity never suspected
until purposely investigated. The first of the Spanish writers
seem to have employed the native terms for the medicine-men, and we
come across them as cemis or zemis, bohiti, pachuaci, and others; but
soon they were recognized as the emissaries of Satan and the preachers
of witchcraft, and henceforth they appear in the documents as "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hechicheros</span>"
and "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">brujos</span>" almost exclusively. "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tienan los Apaches profetas
√≥ adivinos que gozan de la mas alta estimacion. Esos adivinos
pratican la medicina lamas rudimental, la aplicacion de algunas yerbas y
esto acompa√±ado de ceremonias y cantos
supersticiosos.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
Pimentel
seems to have derived his information from Cordero, a Spanish officer
who had served against the Apache at various times between 1770 and
1795, and seemed to understand them well.</p>

<p>"There was no class of persons who so widely and deeply influenced
the culture and shaped the destiny of the Indian tribes as their priests.
In attempting to gain a true conception of the race's capacities and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
history there is no one element of their social life which demands closer
attention than the power of these teachers.... However much
we may deplore the use they made of their skill, we must estimate it
fairly and grant it its due weight in measuring the influence of the religious
sentiment on the history of
man."<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>"Like Old Men of the Sea, they have clung to the neck of their
nations, throttling all attempts at progress, binding them to the
thraldom of superstition and profligacy, dragging them down to
wretchedness and death. Christianity and civilization meet in them
their most determined, most implacable
foes."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>In spite of all the zeal and vigilance of the Spanish friars, supported
by military power, the Indians of Bogot√° clung to their idolatry.
Padre Simon cites several instances and says tersely: "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">De manera
que no lo hay del Indio que parece mas Cristiano y ladino, de que no
tenga √≠dolos √° quien adore, como nos lo dice cada dia la experiencia.</span>"
(So that there is no Indian, no matter how well educated he may appear
in our language and the Christian doctrine, who has not idols which
he adores, as experience teaches us every
day.)<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>"The Indian doctor relied far more on magic than on natural remedies.
Dreams, beating of the drum, songs, magic feasts and dances,
and howling to frighten the female demon from the patient, were his
ordinary methods of
cure."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>In a very rare work by Padre Jos√© de Arriaga, published in Lima,
1621, it is shown that the Indians among whom this priest was sent on
a special tour of investigation were still practicing their old idolatrous
rites in secret. This work may be found quoted in Montesinos, M√©moires
sur l'Ancien P√©rou, in Ternaux-Compans, Voyages, vol. 17; the title of
Arriaga's work is <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Extirpacion de la Idolatr√≠a de los Indios del Peru</span>.
Arriaga also states that the functions of the priesthood were exercised
by both sexes.</p>

<p>It will only be after we have thoroughly routed the medicine-men
from their intrenchments and made them an object of ridicule that we
can hope to bend and train the mind of our Indian wards in the direction
of civilization. In my own opinion, the reduction of the medicine-men
will effect more for the savages than the giving of land in severalty
or instruction in the schools at Carlisle and Hampton; rather, the
latter should be conducted with this great object mainly in view: to
let pupils insensibly absorb such knowledge as may soonest and most
completely convince them of the impotency of the charlatans who hold
the tribes in bondage.</p>

<p>Teach the scholars at Carlisle and Hampton some of the wonders
of electricity, magnetism, chemistry, the spectroscope, magic lantern,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
ventriloquism, music, and then, when they return to their own people,
each will despise the fraud of the medicine-men and be a focus of growing
antagonism to their pretensions. Teach them to love their own
people and not to despise them; but impress upon each one that he is
to return as a missionary of civilization. Let them see that the world
is free to the civilized, that law is liberty.</p>

conspicuous in numerous documents much more recent than the Book of the Dead."&mdash;Hibbert, Lectures,

Races, vol. 1, pp. 387-388. (This chaplain stated so many things
ignorantly that nothing is more probable than that he attempted to
describe, without seeing it, the plant from which the Indians told him
that hoddentin (or downe) was obtained. The principal chief or "king"
would, on such an awe-inspiring occasion as meeting with strange
Europeans, naturally want to cover himself and followers with all the
hoddentin the country afforded.)</p></div>

In burlesque survivals the use of flour prevails not only all over
Latin Europe, but all such portions of America as are now or have been
under Spanish or Portuguese domination. The breaking of eggshells over
the heads of gentlemen upon entering a Mexican ball room is one
manifestation of it. Formerly the shell was filled with flour.</p></div>

Wheat, which, is now the bread corn of twelve European nations and is
fast supplanting maize in America and several inferior grains in India,
was no doubt widely grown in the prehistoric world. The Chinese
cultivated it 2700 B. C. as a gift direct from Heaven; the Egyptians
attributed its origin to Isis and the Greeks to Ceres. A classic
account of the distribution of wheat over the primeval world shows that
Ceres, having taught her favorite Triptolemus agriculture and the art
of bread-making, gave him her chariot, a celestial vehicle which he
used in useful travels for the purpose of distributing corn to all
nations.</p>

<p> Ancient monuments show that the cultivation of wheat had been
established in Egypt before the invasion of the shepherds, and there is
evidence that more productive varieties of wheat have taken the place
of one, at least, of the ancient sorts. Innumerable varieties exist of
common wheat. Colonel Le Couteur, of Jersey, cultivated 150 varieties;
Mr. Darwin mentions a French gentleman who had collected 322 varieties,
and the great firm of French seed merchants, Vilmorin-Andrieux et C<sup>ie</sup>,
cultivate about twice as many in their trial ground near Paris. In
their recent work on Les meilleurs bl√©s M. Henry L. de Vilmorin has
described sixty-eight varieties of best wheat, which he has classed
into seven groups, though these groups can hardly be called distinct
species, since M. Henry L. de Vilmorin has crossbred three of them,
<i>Triticum vulgare</i>, <i>Triticum turgidum</i> and <i>Triticum durum</i>, and has
found the offspring fertile. </p>

<p> Three small-grained varieties of common wheat were cultivated by the
first lake dwellers of Switzerland (time of Trojan war), as well as by
the less ancient lake dwellers of western Switzerland and of Italy, by
the people of Hungary in the stone age, and by the Egyptians, on
evidence of a brick of a pyramid in which a grain was embedded and to
which the date of 3359 B. C. has been assigned. </p>

<p> The existence of names for wheat in the most ancient languages
confirms this evidence of the antiquity of its culture in all the more
temperate parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but it seems improbable
that wheat has ever been found growing persistently in a wild state,
although the fact has often been asserted by poets, travelers, and
historians. In the Odyssey, for example, we are told that wheat grew in
Sicily without the aid of man, but a blind poet could not have seen
this himself, and a botanical fact can hardly be accepted from a writer
whose own existence has been contested. Diodorus repeats the tradition
that Osiris found wheat and barley growing promiscuously in Palestine,
but neither this nor other discoveries of persistent wild wheat seem to
us to be credible, seeing that wheat does not appear to be endowed with
a power of persistency except under culture.&mdash;Edinburgh Review. </p>

<p> The origin of baking precedes the period of history and is involved in
the obscurity of the early ages of the human race. Excavations made in
Switzerland gave evidence that the art of making bread was practiced by
our prehistoric ancestors as early as the stone period. From the shape
of loaves it is thought that no ovens were used at that time, but the
dough was rolled into small round cakes and laid on hot stones, being
covered with glowing ashes. Bread is mentioned in the book of Genesis,
where Abraham, wishing to entertain three angels, offered to "fetch a
morsel of bread." Baking is again referred to where Sarah has
instructions to "make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead
it and make cakes upon the hearth." Lot entertained two angels by
giving them unleavened bread. The mere mention of unleavened bread
shows that there were two kinds of bread made even at that time. </p>

<p> The art of baking was carried on to a high perfection among the
Egyptians, who are said to have baked cakes in many fantastic shapes,
using several kinds of flour. The Romans took up the art of baking, and
public bakeries were numerous on the streets of Rome. In England the
business of the baker was considered to be one so closely affecting the
interests of the public that in 1266 an act of Parliament was passed
regulating the price to be charged for bread. This regulation continued
in operation until 1822 in London and until 1836 in the rest of the
country. The art of making bread has not yet reached some countries in
Europe and Asia. In the rural parts of Sweden no bread is made, but rye
cakes are baked twice a year and are as hard as flint. It is less than
a century ago that bread was used in Scotland, the Scotch people of
every class living on barley bannocks and oaten cakes.&mdash;Chicago
News.</p></div>

"Var (from the Hebrew word <i>var frumentum</i>) Grain. It not only means a
particular kind of grain, between wheat and barley, less nourishing
than the former, but more so than the latter, according to Vossius; but
it means bread corn, grain of any kind. √Ütius gives this application to
any kind of frumentaceous grain, decorticated, cleansed from the husks,
and afterwards bruised and dried." London Medical Dictionary,

a species of dreaming bread prepared by unmarried females with
ingredients traditionally suggested in witching doggerel. When baked,
it is cut into three divisions; a part of each to be eaten and the
remainder put under the pillow. When the clock strikes twelve, each
votary must go to bed backwards and keep a profound silence, whatever
may appear."</p></div>

A writer in the Gentleman's Magazine for July, 1783, inquires: "May not
the <i>minced pye</i>, a compound of the choicest productions of the East,
have in view the offerings made by the wise men who came from afar to
worship, bringing <i>spices</i>, etc." Quoted in Brand, Pop. Ant., vol. 1,
p. 526. The mince pie was before the Reformation made in the form of a
crib, to represent the manger in which the holy child lay in the
stable. Ibid., p. 178.</p></div>
